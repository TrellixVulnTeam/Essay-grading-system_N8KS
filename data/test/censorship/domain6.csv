"There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was an issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen. So, if the dirigibles explode over New York many people could be killed in the very populated. Another problem is keeping the derigible @CAPS1 so people can get off while the wind moves the back end of itself. The only way was to tie lead weights down in the back of the dirigible, but it would be dangerous over people down below. So, these obstacles workers faced, never got past them and so they made the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area.",2
"Him from the start, there would have been many problems with allowing dirigibles to dock some @NUM1 feet in the air. The major problem here would be that the Empire State building was being constructed in New York City, a highly populated area. Below the mooring mast would be several other buildings were other people worked and lived. If something happened while he dirigible was attempting to dock, it could take out the building and the lives of the people in it. Not only that, but below were the city streets, where pedestrians walked. In paragraphs @NUM2, the passage also talks about the stress of a heavy, steel framed airship mooring at the top of the building. The frame would need to be very dense and, as the architects of the project discovered expensive. Other safety issues include the high winds that would drift the dirigibles off course, and the safety of dirigibles themselves. The passage mentions the Hindenburg incident, as well as the worry the owners of the building had about that happening over such a densely populated area.",3
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was that the dirigible would have to be held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the building's frame in order to make the frame or sturdy, there was modifications to the building's framework which cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was the dirigible's use of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Since New York was a densely populated area, this would not work out well. The dirigibles would also have to be weighted down in the back with lead weights. In order to do so, the lead weights would end up dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was a safety issue one last obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area.",3
"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The builders of the Empire State Building faced opstacles in the building of the Empire State Building, in allowing dirigibles to dock there.One reason is that Al Smith (four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office) had made the tower tall... The hight of the building was 1,250 ft. But after almost losing the title of worlds tallest tower he announced that there would be a top or hat put on the tower.Another reason is the tower was made for Dirigibles (blimps) That Could @CAPS2 people from New York to New Jersey. Smith wanted a place where dirigibles could dock off. But it never happened because the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and on May 6, 1937 the owners of the State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it was over New York.In the 1930's the idea was dropped after another dirigible was trying to proform a stunt. The Empire State Building never got to fofil what it was made for.",1
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it illegal for the dirigible to tie up on the building. Another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire over the densely populated area of New York, there would be a good chance that many people would be hurt. A final obstacle faced was ""nature itself."" The winds on the top of the Empire State building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though a dirigible would be attached to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around the mooring mast in a dangerous way. Many obstacles were faced by the workers of the Empire State Building in order to allow a dirigible to dock there.",3
"soon after it's conception, The Empire State Building mooring mast was doomed to fail. Early obstacles were easily surmounted, for example the problem of added stress on the building's frame caused by the added weight of the moored airship. This was fixed by structural modifications to the building's frame, an expensive but fairly simple procedure. one of the biggest blows to the project was the advent of the Hindenburg disaster. The Hindenburg disaster was the cause of the forefront of a decline in airships. Airplanes became a safer, faster, more designer form of transportation. In addition to the Hindenburg disaster, it soon became clear that mooring and airship at @NUM1'or higher was not feasible. Surging winds would not allow the airship to maintain it's course and the ship would be blown erratically around the mast. The final nail in the coffin for the mooring mast was a law prohibiting airship travel over urban areas. These multiple factors easily disallowed any possibility of successful airship travel in the future.",4
The builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building were faced with obstacles while attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. The architects realized they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building without modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much weight to the framework which could cause it to collapse. They strengthened the framework from the bottom of the building to the top before putting the shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower on the top of the building. The builders were faced with these obstacles but they were successful in completing their goal. The mooring mast is not used as a docking station but it is still looked at as the final peice that makes the Empire State Building stand out above all buildings in downtown New York City.,2
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast. One obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy and the metal frame of the building would have to be modified. After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were displayed by the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"". The result of the expirament were that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass. Within years of postponing their efforts, airplanes made way and dirigibles, as transportation, were long forgotten.",3
"The builders of the Empire State Building a great idea. They wanted to be able to tethered dirigibles, or blimps, to the top of the building. However, there were many problems with this idea. First of all, blimps themselves were not very sturdy. Strong winds could easily blow dirigibles trying to dock into the spires of other buildings. Dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than Helium. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable. The smallest the sparking could set the whole blimp ablaze. The docking system its self was also a problem. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side. One concern was that a way could fall off and fall into the densely populated city below. This could've proved very disastrous!",3
"The Empire State Building's docking zone was a magnificent and novel idea when it was first concieved but it was too difficult to implement. Al Smith, who spearheaded the operation, was too over anxious to complete it. Since not enough time was devoted to researching the risk's and structure of the dock, the plan to mount it on top the Empire State Building was already a failure.       Before the construction even began, trouble started to brew. The building couldn't withstand the stress of the @DATE1 foot long dirigible. The shock to the building would have transmitted tremendous pressure to the foundation. So the roof would have to be re-done in order for it to be structurally sound. After many months and @NUM1 dollars, the creation of the landing dock could begin.       Life is precious, and the landing dock was too volatile and dangerous to be used. The architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen not helium. Hydrogen is extremely Flammable. In @LOCATION1, the Hindenburg, which was constructed using hydrogen caught aflame and killed hundreds. There was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area. The idea was ostentatious and showy but because it was rushed, precautions were not taken into account. The obstacles that faced the docking station were too much, so finally the plan to erect it was abandoned.",3
"During the construction of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock, there were constant obstacles faced by the builders. Architects could not place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. @NUM1 ft dirigibles would add stress the buildings framework, therefore causing the architects to modify the framework. This would cost them an extra @MONEY1 for the modifications. The Architects don't know if these modifications will help. Safety is another concern. Foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. For example ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects also had to worry about @ORGANIZATION2 and the constant shifting of the winds due to violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1 dirigibles land in open fields where they are weighed down so they won't drift away, except it is impossible to weigh down the dirigible in the air. They dangle high above pedestrians walking around on the streets, therefore making it not safe. There is also the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" There were two attempts to dock on the building. @NUM2 was in December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles Attempted to dock except it couldn't get close enough to to high velocity winds. ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared."" Airplanes became the future.",4
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to construct this marvelous building One obstacle was making sure the stress of the building from the dirigible would go to the foundation of the building and not the top or middle where it could cause it to collapse. As said in the text ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" @CAPS1 the building had to be changed in many ways to make it stable enough for dirigible to dock.Another obstacle was the weather above the building which was very strong winds and air currents. This would mean that the dirigible would just be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" and that's not a safe thing to have highly flammable hydrogen floating around above millions. An obstacle as well that came with these dirigibles was all the time and effort they had to put in to learn how to safely install a mooring mast. This took people going to professionals like the Navy and finding out the proper way. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building caused many obstacles to get in the way.",4
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Al Smith was the architect, and man behind the idea of the Empire State building. He and the maker of the Chrysler building were competing against eachother to construct the world's tallest building. To make the Empire State building bigger than the Chrysler building, Smith was going to construct somthing that John Tauranac stated, ""Would be equipped for an age of transportation that was only the dream of aviation pioneers"". That dream was to travel by blimp. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for the dock of air ships. It was not going to be as easy as the concept. The architects couldn't drop a mooring mass on the roof because it would stress the buildings frame. The greatest reason the mast would never fufill its destiny was for safety. The excerpt states, ""Most derigibles used hydrogen"". Hydrogen is flammable. There was also a law that was, ""against air ships flying too low over urban areas"". After numberous attempts and modifications, the idea was shelved.",2
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would dirigible's to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on, the electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and get passengers could safely get on and off The dirigible by walking down a gang @CAPS1 to an open observation platform. They of the Empire state Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations of the U.S. Naval Air station in Lakehurst, New Jersey.",2
"The @CAPS1 The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, shows the thoughtful, intelligent, yet obstacled ideas of attaching a landing dock to the Empire State building. The obstacles that builders of the Empire State building had to overcome were that wind speeds where the dirigibles would land were too strong and would whip the balloon around like a rag doll. They would ""have to use lead weights"" which would pose another problem, questioning the foundation of the building. The weight of the building also the weight of the lead weights might collapse the structure. The gases they use ""hydrogen and hellium"" make the balloon fly, but hydrogen ""is highly flamable and can't be used in populated areas."" There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 are the obstacles and the reason ""the mooring mast of The Empire State building was destined never to fullfill its purpose"".",3
"In Marcia Amidon Lsted's excerpt, The Mooring Mast, many obstacles had the engineers of the Empire state building looking for a new way to dock dirigibles. One obstacle they had to face was the steel work of the building. The pressure of the wind and the dirigibles load had cost the company @MONEY1. Secondly, they had to design a few special floors for the passengers of the dirigibles. One floor would be for baggage and suitcases while a special observation deck was set up for passengers to exit or enter the ship. Lastly, the building would now be 102 floors and would need to be very durable so special materials were needed to be brought in and used to create the building. All in all, the Empire State Building engineers had to overcome many obstacles when constructing the 1,250 ft. building.",1
"The builders of the empire state buildings had many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Things such as the wind, the actual docking, and the people getting off safely. The actual docking was impractical it would be nearly impossible to connect the winch.     The wind was the main reason for the fate of the mast. First the wind current was so strong that the pilot would have a very difficult time getting close enough. The captain of the, ""Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also even if it could tie up the back of the dirigible would swing around fiercefuly. So the builders were dealing with an impractical task",2
"The first obstacle that it faced with having to reconstruct the body frame so that it could support the mooring mast, The second is that dirigibles from other country's used hydrogen, wich is highly flammable, instead of helium. The third reason wich should have been apparent from the start was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The last reason is the wind conditions at that hight made it impossible for the dirigibles to land there without the tail and swaying in the wind.",3
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.",2
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was constructing a mooring mast that would not threaten the buildings structure. The builders had to modify and strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building. According to the excerpt ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" Another big obstacle was safety. At the Empire State Building's hight it would have been illegal to land a dirigible. The dirigibles, at that time, were filled with hydrogen. If the dirigible ever exploded, it would threaten the hundreds. of pedestrians on the streets of New York City.",3
"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred Feet below."" The winds current would cause the dirigible to drag the building with it because the wind current is very strong. The weight of the dirigible and the pressure of the wind may cause the building to collapse."" Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building would now reach the height of 1,250 Feet."" Al Smith didn't want to lose his title so he decides to to make the building taller. The taller the building gets the stronger the wind current will be the more it adds on the building.""

Dirigibles should land in wide open areas where there isn't anything to harm the blimp, citizens, and passengers.

"In the reading The Mooring Mast written by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle. Which was attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there.  Not to mention Dirigibles were thought of being the transportation of the future. First, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@NUM1). This quote shows that for one this Dirigible would need to find a proper landing area. As well as not being able to fit. Thus, there was some need of more area space. Also, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (@NUM2). It seems as though there was not enough space due to the Dirigible being so long. It also shows how would these architects come up with a plan in making this work, so that way it would fit properly. Therefore, there was an obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced. Which was the lack of a suitable area.",2
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced difficult circumstances and many obstacles during the task of designing a brand new Empire State Building to accompany this new means of travel. The builder's mission was to design the top of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring of blimps over one thousand feet in the air. The first obstacle was designing a landing area. This was difficult because the architecture needed had never before been created or even attempted in the past. A second obstacle was having to make sure the Empire State Building could withstand the stress created by the blimp. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The difficulty with this obstacle was having to refurbish the steel frame at the Empire State Building which took lots of time, work, and over sixty thousand dollars. ""The greatest obstacles to successful mooring was nature itself."" There were violent wind currents at the top of the building and the blimps were never very stable. There were many pedestrians under a moored dirigible so this was a very dangerous obstacle. Lastly, the pre existing laws of airships flying the low over urban areas posed a new problem. even with successful architecture, laws disallowed the blimps in the first place! Planes were also becoming more popular.",4
"In building the Empire State Building, the builders faced some problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles that the builder faced were actually having a way for dirigibles to dock at about 1,250 feet above the ground. The strong air currents and changing in the wind direction also made it difficult for the piolots to steer the dirigibles close enough to the mast for docking. A final problem that the builders faced was a law that ""airships flying too low over urban areas"". (@NUM1). Which basically means that if it was docked at the Empire State building, then it would be too low to an urban aera and that's against the law.",2
"The idea of mooring dirigibles to the top of the building that stood 1,250 feet above the streets of downtown New York was a facinating and amazing idea. An idea that would bring New York into a whole ""age of transportation"" (@NUM1). Unfortunately this wonderful idea had a few holes in the plans. Later the architects that were building the mooring mast had discovered that their idea was not going to be fulfill. The idea had too many obstacles to overcome. The fact that ""most dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM2). If anything was to go wrong, it would be catostrophic seeing as how below them were highly populated streets. Also, ""the greatest obstacle was nature itself"" (@NUM3). There was just too much wind to keep the aircraft steady and undercontrol. The reality of the fact was that the idea to moor derigibles sounded great but there are far too many risks to carry out the plan.",2

"The builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was the safety issue.

Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even ""swivel around the mooring mast."" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, there was many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with allowing diriibles to land there. One of the obstacles were the safety problems. The drigibles had to come close enough to the Empire State building so they could be able to tie the dirible down. This put the diribles too close to the people. There was a law that that stated that airships can't fly to low to urban areas. There was a disaster that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey that they were trying to prevent from happening in New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another problem with that builders faced was that the strong winds of nature did not allow diribles to get close enough to tie down to the mast. There were many obstacles builders had to face that at the end it was not worth making the Empire state building a dirible dock.",3
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The steel frame of the Building needed to be modified and strengthened to make a place for dirigibles to dock. Also, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made. The last obstacle builders had was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame. It was not easy for builders to build a mooring mast on top of the highest building that was one thousand two hundred fifty feet, but the architects reached their point by designing the mooring mast.",2
"While building the Empire State Building, workers faced many obstactles while attempting for dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible attached to the mast and building would add extra stress, so builders instead had to over sixty thousand dollars worth of reconstructions to fix the buldings framework. Dirigibles also dock with a line running from the front of the ship to the mast, and while they planned for the blimp to be able to sway in the wind, it was unrealistic that any ship could attach to the building at the high winds.Other obstacles they faced in letting dirigibles dock the building, was because of the safety hazards, the hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. is highly flammable. Builders also did not take into consideration the pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas, so it was illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building. The task of having dirigibles attach to the Empire State building was an impossible task to begin with. ",3
"There were many reasons why architects had problems allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. One of the problems was that most dirigibles were @NUM1 ft long and it would be to much. There Would only be a single cable tether and it would add stress to the buildings frame. The entire Steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.The greatest reason why the mooring mast would never fullfill its purpose is safety. Most dirigibles from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obsticale to the successful use of the mooring was nature itself. The winds on the top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the Ship would swivel around.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although the builders thought it to be a brilliant idea, they did not carefully consider the safety hazards they may have encountered, and how unrealistic the idea truly was.

In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When a dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse an accident like that would be if it occurred over a place as densely populated as downtown New York. Another very practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the top of the building was, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the area, let alone be able to tie up to the building. It is very apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many issues in the attempt.",3
"The builders of the Empire State building seem blind of all the dangers that would be a result of the mooring mast. One huge factor in danger was the violent winds at that elevation. The blimp would be swung around on the tether going to the building, which could either damage the building itself, or damage the blimp. Alsoif  the blimp was moving, how would passangers get on and off? They could fall off the loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp. Passengers could even get blown off the open floor of the Empire State building. Another factor was the high population of New York City, if something like debris had fallen down to the streets, it could probably kill a few walking pedestrians. I would think that the architects would have considered all these factors before trying to begin the project.",2
"In the excerpt, the Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the construction of the Empire State Building faces many problems. One of these problems is that the governer of New York, Al Smith wanted the building to be the tallest in the world. In order to do this you would need a mask to break the record. The mask made to made nature a danger to the whole building because of violent air current. Another reason how the Empire State Building failed is because their was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This law went in effect because of a German dirigible caught on fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.

Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building that would making docking difficult and could possibly blow a dirigible into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured.

The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of the use of a mooring mast was the wind. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Another reason the dirigibles would not be able to more at the Empire State Building is because there is a law that says airships cannot fly low in urban areas. This would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the Empire State Building.,2
"Based on the story it all started when they had build the empire state building and the workers should have knowned that the building was too big for the wind climate, up in the sky and plus when you make a building like that you have to make sure it's strong enough to keep balance.                         They faced problem's like when the U.S. tried to make a deal with them if they would let them use the top of the building for a dock to let civilians on the deck, and after they made a law that no more blimps can land on the dock a blimp attempted to land on the dock.",1

Another obstacle the builders faced was the winds of nature itself. Even if a dirigible was docked, it would still swivel around too much. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""... they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" One more obstacle they faced was an existing law. In paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The architects faced many obstacles while trying to bring their idea to reality. It's better to plan ahead and think of every obstacle before bringing ideas to life.",3
"The builders had a very hard time because of where it was located, and how the dirigible was to dock. Their first problem was the fact that it was so tall, it was hard to work on. Another problem was the fact that the blimp would be pulling in on the building, so it had to be reinforced. The final problems that made them most an unreliable choice, were the wind conditions and the fact that the tail end of the blimp could swing freely. These all contributed to make the mast on the Empire State Building a bad idea.",2
"From the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the architechs building the Empire state building faced many obstacles. in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced in attempting to let the drigbles to dock there we're the winds. As it says in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" The dirigible would not be stable. Another obstacle they faced was to weigh it down, they'd have to use lead weight but it wouldnt be ""practical nor safe"" dangling high above people in @LOCATION1 on the Street. Overall The architecs faced a lot of obstacles for docking the dirigibles, Most being either practical or not safe.",2
"There were many problems with allowing dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building. When designing the mast they realized that with the weight of the dirible, the buildings frame would have stress. (paragraph @NUM1) They also noticed that the diribles from other countries used hydrogen and not helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @NUM2). A factor of building the mast that was out of the builders control was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. (paragraph @NUM3). Law was also a problem when wanting to construct the mast. There was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. (paragraph @NUM4). With the factors of weight, gas, nature, and law the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles.",2
"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lsted, tells about the original purpose to the mast on top of the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps).Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the tremendous stress that the mast would put on the Empire State Building. In order to get around this, they put frame work around the entire building's frame. Another obstacle that was faced was safety. First of all, the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was to great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around. Finally, the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen, over New York City.In conclusion, the mast on the Empire State Building, looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements, the mast had too many flaw to it.",2
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was modifying and strengthening the frame of the building. It says that ""over @NUM1 thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" in order to accommodate dirigibles. However, after the modifications were made, the builders had to face another set of obstacles, more serious than before. the first one was ""safety"": the destruction of the Hindenburg in @LOCATION3 raised fear for a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle was ""nature""; the strong winds and violent air currents on the top of the Empire State Building made dirigibles ""neither practical nor safe"". the third obstacle was ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". this law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" the Los Angeles and Columbia dirigibles attempted a few things, but unsuccessfully, and the idea of dirigibles disappeared by the late 1930's. these are the obstacles that the builders faced in attempting dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building.",4
"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a number of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. The greatest obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. @PERSON1 stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" therefore it wasn't safe for dirigibles to be docked there. The wind would cause them to swivel around the mast, and it would be unsafe for the builders to hang lead weights on the dirigibles because they would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street. The other obstacle which prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building was due to the law against airships flying too low over urban areas or cities. This existing law made it illegal for dirigibles to ever tie up to the building or just approach it because the area was too low over the city. @PERSON1 said, ""although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped."" @CAPS1 two dirigibles failed at getting close enough to tie up or to deliver there cargo safetly, because of the forceful winds and the non-existence of certain mooring equipment, which should've been installed. Due to the obstacles, dirigibles were never able to moor at the building.",3
"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted the builders of the Empire State Building endured many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. The idea of a mooring mast began when former governor of New York, Al Smith was determined to make the Empire State building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler building became the tallest Smith was said to have announced, ""... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet"" (Mooring Mast). Although many were enthusiastic about the plan, there were many obstacles before dirigibles docked there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand pound dirigible was connected to the building by one tether then it, ""... would add stress to the buildings frame"" (Mast) Which would have made the builders completely alter the buildings structure. Another reason was safety At the time most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. Which could be a great hazard considering all the people it could harm below. However, the greatest obstacles for the dirigibles future was nature. Above the Empire State there was wild wind currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. When builders couldn't find a practical solution to all these obstacles, it was realized dirigibles would not be kept there for the safety of all New York City inhabitants.",3
"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @PERSON1, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with that should have been apparent before they built the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" It says in the ""The Mooring Mast"" that at the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also if the dirigibles were tethered, the back of them would move around while the dirigibles would also be high above the city with people watching. Unsafe for many. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" It's illegal for a ship to tie up with the building or to even go to an area like that. These thing should have been brought to the builders attention with obstacles such as nature and lawbreaking are in play.",2
"Based on excerpt builders of Empire State building faced alot of obsticles. Here are my three points to consider. They need to make plans that were very difficult and hard. The Blimps and @CAPS2 could crash in to the building. It was too high firstly. The builders needed to make long difficult, plans. They needed to make the right skeleton for the mast to fit the rest of the building. They had to make changes to the existing plans to fit the mooring mast. Secondly, The Blimps and @CAPS2 could cause an accident. Blimps fly about @NUM1 miles per hour and they could approach the mast at a speed that is too fast and destroy it. Lastly, The mast was very high. It would be hard for blimps to reach the height of the mast. Irving Clavan said, ""... Such a height made it desirable to post poned to a later date for the landing gears."" In @CAPS1 builders of the Empire State building faced a lot of obsticles. The plans were difficult the Blimps and @CAPS2 could crash and the mast height was too high.",2
"Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly weather and safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This means that because of the wind and air currents always shifting the the dirigibles would be hard to control. Another obstacle they faced was safety. Also in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" @CAPS1 that means is having something heavy dangling above people is not a good idea. It wouldn't be a good idea because if the weight would of disconnected from the dirigibles there is a possibility that somebody could get injured badly. Those obstacles are @CAPS1 builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.",3
"Thraghat The process of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle that the bilders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there occurred in the actual ""building"" process. Because the mast wald add to much stress to the frame of the building if simply attached to its flat roof, the buldas had to reconstruct the steel frame of the building in order to safely place the mast on top, a very expensive and time consuming project. Another obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building had to to with nature itself. Because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting the back of the ship wald swivel around the mooring mast which was very unsafe. The laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also proved to be an obstacle because the Ships would never be able to actually approach the area. In conclusion, the builders faced many obstacles during construction for the dirigibles.",3
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. So that was an obstacle because if the workers were up there working with that it would have to of been a very dificult situation and chalenging to work on the building with it like that. Another obstacle I would have to say would be the wind pressure they had when the thouand-foot dirigible was only hung on by a single cable that must of been a difficult obstacle with the wind blowing hard. Over sixty thousand dollers' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work must have been a challenging obstacle because they had to do alot of work that would take a while to get done if it has all over sixty thousand dollers' worth of work they had to do @CAPS1 on the frame work.",1

The architects would have to strengthen and modify the Empire State Building for it to be accustomed to this new situation. The architects also saw problems with foreign dirigibles which use hydrogen rather than helium as said in paragraph @NUM2, ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" One of the biggest obstacle was how the winds on top of the building were always shifting so even if the dirigible is tethered to the mast, the back would still swivel around.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. Some of these obstacles had easy solutions, but some of them were really hard to solve.One obstacle they had was the dirigible on top of the building being hold by a cable tether only would cause stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem they needed to make modifications that would cost around six thousand dollars. This wasn't the only problem, there was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to get close to this area or even try to get tie up to the building. Adding to this, the most difficult obstacle the architects faced was nature, and this problem was hard to solve and also hard to control.All this obstacles they faced lead them to give up for now & wait to see if later with more technology the could finally make this dream come true.",2
"When they build the Empire State Building they faced obstacles building it. An obstacle they faced was that they wanted to make it as high and as safe as possible. The way the architetures wanted to make it the tallest building in the world was by putting a mooring mast on the top of the building. A mooring mast is basically a dock for dirigibles (blimps). This was dangerous. It was because the Mast could snap at such a high altitude and plumate to the ground or snap, and dangle high above the street. ""... The Government people in washington are figuring on some way of mooring airships to this mast,"" says Al Smith four year term governor of New York. Although it may look nice, its not the safest idea.",1
"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the empire state building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". To change and fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars would be needed for the modifications. Another obstacle the builder's failed to see was the actual construction of a modern-day dirigible. The dirigibles, ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable"". If the dirigibles were to ever explode while docking, the situation would have been horrible over a densely populated area of New York.

This factor caused that the owners of the Building to worry about the safety of the many civilians that lived in downtown New York. Another factor that the builders face was that the winds ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This caused problems because in landing fields the blimps could be weighted down with lead weights but that could not be done at the Empire State Building; many dirigibles would not be able to reach the Building either due to the winds. One last factor that was faced is that it is against the law to have airships fly to low over the urban areas. This ""law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" All these factors caused ""the idea of using the mooring mast for drigibles and passengers"" to disappear.",4
"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 There is an obsticle that the builders had to over come. Building the top of the empire state building was difficult because the dock part of the tower wasn't stable. Also the frame of the building couldn't support the dirigible, ""dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". The designers designed a new tower that was a ""shinny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside"". The winches and controlling machinery would be housed in the base of the shaft its self. They also added a observation deck and more passengers were able to wait for the dirigible. another problem with it was there was a law that aircrafts couldn't get to close to urban places. Over all it was a hard pain saking design for them and costed alot of money.",2
"Despite Al Smith's goal of fulfilling the ""dream of aviation pioneers,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem that the builders faced was the stress a dirigible would add to the building itself; by mooring a large dirigible to the building by a single cable tether, the building would have to be able to withstand the stress of the dirigible itself and the wind pressure that would be transmitted throughout the entire building. Thus, the builders were forced to strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building with over @MONEY1 of modifications. In addition, dirigibles from outside the United States posed as a danger hazard due to most of them being filled with highly flamable hydrogen. When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it became obvious of the risks of such an accident above a densely populated city of New York. Not only that, but the raging winds on top of the Empire State Building also posed a problem as even when tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the ship would continually sway around the mooring mast; this proved to be a danger hazard with the citizens of New York directly below it. Furthermore, there was an established law prohibiting airships from flying to low over urban areas; this made it illegal for a dirigible to tether itself to the Empire State Building and further cemented the impossibility for the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",4

So if one blew up like it did in Lakehurst, New Jersey more people would be effected by it. Yet another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there is because they could use lead weights to weigh down the back of the blimp because that would be dangerous for the people below Another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed is because of the sharp spires of the other buildings in the area. If a Navy captain was afraid of having his blimp poped then no one should be allowed. The last reason was that there was a law saying that air ships can't fly too low over urban Areas.

"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building had to face while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason is the dirigibles were unsafe. This is because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. If the dirigible caught on fire in a densely populated place, then many people could die from it. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting so the back of the dirigible would swivel back and forth. They could only fix the problem by putting weights on the back of the ship, but to do that impractical and unsafe. This is because the weights are dangling high above pedestrians, so if one broke, it could kill someone. The third obstacle is that there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the ships tie up to the building.

"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, many obstacles of building the Empire State building as a docking station for dirigibles are describle. John Tauranac, the man who came up with the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the empire state building forgot some very important things to take into account. First the entire building would have to be modified because ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stres to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The second problem that would need to be solved would be the safety of the city. Many ""dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM2.). If an accident like German dirigible Hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse. Lastly, the ""violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM3) would pose as one of the greatest obstacles. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to tie up but could not get close enough because of ""forceful wind."" (paragraph @NUM4). The obstacles of making the empire state building into a mooring mast caused too many obstacles that could not be solved.",3
"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of a building had never been done before.

Builders with that would have to construct the building to make it more stable. Also there were cases that outside the United States they use Hydrogen other then helium.

Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is very flammable, and after the ""Hindenburg"" accident in Lakehurst, the idea was shot down. Another reason why it just didn't work was the wind current at the top of the Empire State building. Winds would have been to great for dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State. There was already a law about Airships flying too low over urban areas. With a dirigible approaching the building would make it illegal. Thus ending the idea to proceed.",3

In regards to docking these dirigibles, they were breaking ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Which made the builders' procedure illegal. Also, not only was it a dangor for the citizens of New York City, but due to the weather conditions it was dangorous for passengers and workers on the dirigible.

"Al Smith's dream of having airships dock atop the Empire @CAPS1 Building Was cut short by bitter reality. The idea failed parially due to the impracticality of docking a @DATE2 foot balloon filled with flamable gas to a city building. The mere size of this glimpse was astounding and this created many problems. Firstly The wind atop a skyscrapper is great and inconsitent. It is extremely difficult to dock to a building a seen when the Los Angeles tried to dock in @DATE1. The balloon was unable to dock due to potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city. The blimps were also kept afloat by Hydrogen which due to its chemical nature is extremly flamable. Blimps had exploded in the past such as the Hindenburg. Engineers knew that if a similar accident occurred at the Empire state Building, substantial damage would have been done to the city and building itself. These impracticalities combined with the use of airplanes rather than blimps gaurenteed no blimps would ever be docked to the Empire State Building.",3
"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One of which being that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used Hydrogen to float, making them very flammable and unsafe. If a blimp were to be damaged over New York, many people could be hurt. Also, nature itself made docking extremely difficult. Winds made the blimps very unstable. If one were tied to the mast, winds could wrap the line around the mast. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any ship to even approach the mast.",2
"Al Smith and his team of builders faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The first problem with docking dirigibles is that the steel frame and foundation could not support The stress put on it by a dirigible attached to it. Also, when the builders looked back on past dirigible accidents like the Hindenburg, they realized that if an accident were to occur, many lives would be at stake. Furthermore, there were laws that limited how low a dirigible could fly over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building because it would be too low. Finally, and according to the builders, most importantly, the largest problem with docking dirigibles to the Empire State Building was mother nature. Winds at the top of the building were very high and changed unpredictably, effectively turning the dirigible docked into a disaster waiting to happen.",3

A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building held by only one cable would cause to much stress to the buildings frame. the load of the dirigible and the wind would have to go to the buildings foundation, which was much to far below. The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. The architects made changes to the building to fit these needs. But again the architects we're presented with a problem. The mast of the building would cause problems that should have been spotted by the architects way befor construction. the biggest problem having to do with safety issues. most dirigible outside the country used hydrogen wich is highly flammable. There already had been an exsplosion one over New York could be to much.",2
"In order to allow dirigibles to dock on the roof of the empire state building, the workers would have to go through a series of tasks such as, strengthening the steel frame, and designing a sturdy mast. If the frame were not strong enough, then the building would simply colapse. More than sixty thousand dollars was spent on restructuring the frame. Also with high-speed winds the mast would have be incredibly sturdy, otherwise the dirigible would not stay in one place. After the Hindenburg disaster, people realized how unsafe these dirigibles really were, and so the idea would was found not only unsafe but it illegal. In conclusion, not a single blimp would ever be docked, nor will one ever.",2
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the thousand foot dirigible would attach to the buildings by a single cable, adding stress to the frame of the building. The builders were forced to modify and strengthen the foundation to address the issue of stability. similarly, builders had to deal with the issue of wind pressure which were constantly shifing at heights of over @NUM1 feet in the air. The load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit pressure and stress onto the buildings foundation. This was a high safety concern, and pivotal to the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the empire state building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders faced significant obstacles such as building weakness, safety, and law enforcement, that made attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State's mooring mast, virtually impossible.",3
"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith wanted to add a ""top"" or a ""hat"" to the Empire State Building that would function as a docking station for dirigibles. The dream was not ment to be.The first of many problems was getting the mooring mast, docking station, on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" A dirigible would only be held by one cable.The dirigible's load and the wind presure would have to be transmitted all the way down the building. There were also safety problems. A lot of dirigibles used hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. It is also very windy around the Empire State Building. The dirigibles would have to hang sandbags by ropes. These would hang above the people below. The mooring mast was a good idea, but the builders faced to many problems. The project was never completed.",3
"Though in theory the idea of the mooring mast seemed attainable, in reality there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An initial problem was faced during the process of adding the mooring mast to the building. As stated in the article: ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ... The steel frame... would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" This modification, necessary to overcome the obstacle of attaching the mooring mast consumed over @NUM1 thousand dollars and much time and effort. A second obstacle which interfered immensely with safety was ""nature itself."" The violent winds at the top of the building would cause tethered dirigibles to ""swivel around and around"" the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in airfields could be weighted down by lead weights, but this idea could not be executed because ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Such problems as these created many obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building.",3
"In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and could cause the dirigible to swerve. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be unsafe. At any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. Which could also cause harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there.",3
"The architects of the Empire State building believed that dirigibles were able to dock on the building if there was a mooring mast. However there were many obstacles to over-come to allow this to happen. If a dirigible landed on the mast, it would force a lot of pressure on the building as it swayed in the wind. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored... would add stress to the buildings frame."" And as nature played a role, the wind could swing the body of the dirigible possibly causing the frame of the building to break and the building to collapse.Another obstacle that the architects faced was danger. American dirigibles used helium, while dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. ""... the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey..."" The architects realized that they Hindenburg explosion would have been worst if it occurred on the Empire State building ""... above a densely populated area..."".",3
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon lusted theres alot of problems when trying to add a dock for dirigibles at the top.

Another obstacle was nature itself, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2). The last problem was the existing law aganist airships flying too low over cities or urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (@NUM3).

"Through the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, we learned that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the summit of the building. Some of the obstacles that the builders faced in this enginering challenge are; @CAPS1 the builders faced the challenge of how the Empire State Building was going to be able to support the weight of these long aircrafts. We learned this in paragraph @NUM1 when the author states ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" To overcome this problem ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened (@NUM2)."" It is later said that these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem that the builders faced was, how safe docking a blimp would be in a highly populated area.  In paragraph @NUM3 we learned that most dirigibles are made of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey... The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" All in all in the excerpt The Mooring Mast will learned that the builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the peak of the building.",3
"The builders of the empire state building could not dock dirigibles because of the building's structure, the winds pushing the dirigibles, and public safety. The structure could not handle the swaying dirigible becacse of the winds pushing the back side. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. this quote shows how dangerous it would be to put a large flammable dirigible over new york and the people in new york.",2
"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained why there is a landing area on the Empire State Building called the Mooring Mast. The first obstacle the workers faced was there was no Landing space on the top of the Empire State Building. This means dirigibles could @CAPS4 at all. To fix the problem of not having a Landing area is, they would add the Mooring Mast. The Mooring Mast was built with wenches that would hold the dirigibles but it would put too much stress on the building. The workers used a @CAPS2 of money to make the building so it wasn't stressed when the dirigibles was held to the Mooring Mast. After all that got fixed they forgot one thing, the wind. The wind was so violent that the dirigible couldn't maneuver. to get on top of the Empire State Building. When the workers figured that out they gave up. Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained what the workers tried to do to get a dirigible to @CAPS4 on the Empire State Building in the excerpt The Mooring Mast.",2
"Most of the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building had were due to weather. If New York ever had a windy day the dirigible would pull at the mast. The mast is attached to the ""@CAPS1"" of the building, and it might affect the frames or ""@CAPS1"" of the building. Another reason is the danger it would bring to all of New York. If a dirigible ever hit something or something went wrong the dirigible would @CAPS3 on top of New York. With all the trafic of New York you would most likly not want a burning dirigible falling overhead.",2
"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders could not simply just drop a mooring mast on the roof. It would add stress to the building's frame. Another problem that faced the builders was that hydrogen is very flamable. If a dirigible had been caught on fire and exploded, over downtown New York, then law suites would be made. Another problem that faced the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the winds at the top of the building. There were shifting winds due to violent air currents and these winds would make it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock. The last obstacle was the fact that there was a law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",3
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obsticales in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem with the height and alltitude of the Zeppelin. Even if they docked, the back of it would be moving around everywhere from the wind. Another reason was that on May 6, 1937 the Hindenburg was burned to the ground after takeoff. witch means that it was very flamable from using hydrogen instead of helium. All raised safty issues that needed to be sought out.",2
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were long; some were as long as one thousand feet. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front to the back. The architects could not drop a mooring mast on top of the building. A one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be to heavy for the buildings frame. In order for it to work it would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework. Another obstacle was safety. Dirigibles out of the United States contained helium meaning it was highly flammable. If an accident would occur like in Lakehurst, New Jersey then a lot more people would be harmed considering downtown New York was densely populated. Other obstacles were made for the builders of the Empire State building which proves that it was not a good idea to dock dirigibles.",3
"The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One was that they had find away that would not make the building to unstable ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" Another obstacles was the winds would be too strong and not safe for the dirigible to be up there ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A third example would be that it was too dangerous to have the dirigible up there because the gases with in were extremely flamible ""most dirigibles from outside of the united states used Hydrogen... and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The final obstacles the builders would have to face was that there is a law that does not allow airships to come to close to the ground in urban areas. So in conclution we can see that even though it was a good idea to port dirigible is was not a practical one.",4
"In this excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was redesigning the building's original skeleton to fit the needs of the mooring mast. This can be shown when the excerpt states, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers had to change their first design to meet the mandatory requirements for the mooring mast. The workers also had to face the fact that overall, the mooring mast was too dangerous to use. This can be proven when the excerpt says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2). The dirigibles used outside of the United States used a gas they created a dangerous risk for accidents. Another battle the builders had to face was the strong winds. This can be shown when the excerpt quotes, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM3). The winds caused the dirigible to move too much that it became unsafe to use. The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with many obstacles while they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there.",3
"There were many different obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles. For example ""the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Because of the weather itself it caused them not to be able to build the mooring mast. Another reason is ""using the empire state Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". It could easily kill people that were roaming around. Lastly they could not more at the empire State Building because ""It was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas.",2
"During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building the builders faced several obstacles. The greatest obstacle was @CAPS1 Nature. The winds at this height are shifting to frequently causing the dirigible to be tossed around the mast, making it unsafe to board. Another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below. The third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building. These obstacles forced the builders to shelf the mooring mast construction.",3
"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were some of the following. They needed an exact way of getting everything perfect for the job. The whole building process for this job was very complicating and needed the best expertese.In paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith's quote greatly backs up to my point. He says ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast"". It tells just how much people are working on this job.In conclusion, this was a complicated job. They weren't positive if the mast even be able to stay. They also werent positive if the fluids inside would be but a problem factor.",1
"In the piece ""The Mooring MAst,"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, it describes what the mast on the Empire State Building was really for. There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to @CAPS1 on the mast. One problem they faced was that the dirigible landed on the roof would add stress to the building's frame. The stress and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building. This means the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a big issue for the mast. Because the dirigibles used hydrogen, it could catch on fire and be destroyed over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. This made the back of the ship swivel around. Lastley, it was not successful is because of the law against airships flying too low. Before the constructors built all this extra to the building they should have thought of all the defects it could have.",3
"Although the idea for turning the mast at the top of the Empire State building into a docking area for dirigibles was a highly clever idea, it was not a very safe one at all. One ""reason why dirigibles could not moor the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law left the idea of the mast as a failure before construction even began, but the workers failed to notice this law. Another obstacle that added difficulty to the construction was how much pressure having the dirigibles moored to the building added to the base of the building. This caused another @MONEY1 to be spent trying to fix this problem. A third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more difficult came straight from nature itself. The winds that high off the ground made manuvering the dirigible in such a small space very difficult. This was proven when ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy Dirigible' Los Angeles' approach the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.",3
"There are many things in life that seem like they could be brilliant ideas but, in reality there are many flaws with it. One of these ideas is using the Empire State building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is what Al Smith, the governor of New York at the time, discovers in an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted. In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: @CAPS1 building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the @LOCATION1. If the highly flamable helium inside the dirigibles then it would be putting thousands of peoples lives in jeopardy. Finally the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp. Overall there are many reasons why the Mooring Mast never became a reality.",3
"The idea of docking dirigables on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one It seems as though the dream of dirigable transportation was on it's way up, however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al @CAPS1 competitive nature not only pushed the building to a un-precedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, And effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blowup over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigable plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed by the late 1930's the idea of dirigables a top the Empire State Building had disappeared.",3
"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. The builders of the Empire State Building failed to realized that building the mast would create too many problems and safety risks. Without thinking about the obstacles, the mooring mast also had problem on its own anyways. According to the excerpt, one of its greatest obstacle was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This resulted to being a problem because the dirigible could go anywhere, not landing in the mast properly and cause damage. With this problem also came risks for pedestrians who are on the streets. The dirigibles ""...could be weighted down in the back with lead weights"" because it used open landing fields. This was not a good idea to be using these at the Empire State Building. Another thing builders should have considered was that there was a law in place already that is ""...against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All in all, there were alot of things that builders should have considered before attempting to allow dirigible to dock there",3
"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that the architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. There needed to be modifications made to make it safe for a dirigible to land there. The biggest obstacle was nature. Lsted said it best in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The final problem the builders faced was, even if they did manage to figure out a way to put the mooring mast up, there was still a law stating dirigibles illegal to land there. Lsted said in paragraph @NUM2, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Obviously, from the examples given, the builders of the Empire State building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",3
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were wheather. Nature itself would ruin the time frame of building. Winds would shift, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.Another challenge the builders ran into was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.",2
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring at the top of the building. The main challenge was caused by nature itself. The winds above the building were constantly blowing and shifting direction. This would cause any dirigible attempting to dock swing around and below in the wind, which poses many safty risks for passengers going on and off the zepplen. The dirigible could also puncture its frame on nearby buildings while attempting to dock, which also causes safty risks for people on the building and on the ground. Have a zepplen attatched to the building also made it structurally unstable and modifications had to be made the frame of the building to give it more support. In the end, the idea was dropped because it would never work and was unrealistic.",3
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced while trying to dock dirigibles. One obstacle was nature. At the top of the building, the winds constantly changing because violent air currents. This would make a ship swivel around dangerously. Even if it was tied in the back would move. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of ship with swivel."" Another obstacle was safety. Foreign ships use hydrogen, and extremely flammable gas. In fields, they use lead weights to weight down. If an accident happened with either it would be extremely fatal. A flaming dirigible or a falling metal object  at extreme heights would cause serious injuries because the landing is above a highly populated city. ""Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen... is highly flammable."" ""Could be weighted down by lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be hanging high above pedestrians on the street."" A law forbids ships to fly in low urban areas so, if the moore worked it couldn't be used. These events led to the quiet dissaperance of the thought in the late 1930's.",3
"Throughout the passage, the builders were faced with many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Al Smith had the idea to have dirigibles be a new form of transportation. The idea sounded great with the dirigibles moving at a rate of seventy five miles per hour and moving thousands of feet without needing to be refuled. Anxious, Al smith was very unsure of when the would all be done, saying, ""it's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" It would just not be possible for the architect to drop the huge mooring mass on top of the buildings flat roof. Another problem would be the violent wind currents. The fate of the dirigible had faded out. Airplanes became more suitable to passengers then dirigibles.",1
"There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was they would have to change & fix the @CAPS1 of the Building in order to compensate for all the Stress there would be on the Building when the dirigibles landed. After they constructed & built the landing, there were several more problems. The first problem was that the hydrogen in the balloons is very flammable. This is a problem because New York is densely populated & with a flammable substance above there heads, it poses a threat. The second problem was the dirigible itself. It can easily blow in the wind, & would constantly wave in the wind, & unlike in a field, weights cold not be tied to the back of it because of the crowds below. The third & final problem they dealt with was the law: airships are not allowed too fly low over urban areas. The Empire State Building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it. Several of these problems led to the failure of the original idea & left the Empire State Building with a tall post of no purpose.",3
"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was that it wouldnt be able to tie cable tether, because it adds stress to the buildings frame. Also in the story they tell you how the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommadate to the new situation.",2
"In ""The Mooring Mast"" many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Many of the reasons had to do with safety. Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good many things could of gone wrong. The Empire State building was a enormous structure for it's time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on ""winds""  would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to menuver the dirigibles. Also most of the dirigibles from other countrys such as @LOCATION2 used ""hydrogen"" in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were ""hailed"" as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. For the dirigibles at the time they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State building lookd good they still had to be care ful with the building and the people below, and for the German hydrogen filled blimps were not good terms of safety over a populated city.",3
"The builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One being the changes in wind current. The dirigibles did have steering systems, and could be tethered however the wind could overpower these systems causing it to loose controll and crash. Another obstacle was the fear of another ""Hindenburg"" accident. On May 6, 1937, the hinden burg (a dirigible) that, like all other dirigibles, contained hydrogen (a highly flamible gas) was ignited and burned down, keeping the casualties mainly to the men and women on board, however, if this incident happened above the highly populated @CAPS1.Y.C. the number of deaths would increase due to the pedestrians below.",2
"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attemting to allow dirigibles to dock there are safty and nature.                                                                                                                         Safty was an obstacle because most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium and because hydrogen is flammible it was not safe at all because it could have caught fire just like the ""Hindenburg caught fire in 1937 so the owners of the Empire state building saw how it was unsafe for the public and the building. Nature is another obstacle because the wind currents on the top of the building kept shifting because of violent air currents. Those are some examples of some obstacles the builders of the Empire state building had.",2
"Although high expectations were concieved for the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as explained in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The dream of having a mooring mast to dock new airships was quickly halted when architects first discovered the stress that a dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would add to the building's fame. As a result, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would...be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (paragraph @NUM1). Consequently, architects had to reinforce the buildings framework to accommodate the tremendous amounts of stress. Secondly, the owners of the Empire State Building found that a law concerning airships became an obstacle as well. Stating that airships could not fly too low over populated urban areas, the law became another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor atop the miraculous building. Finally, architects had also discovered the greatest obstacle to their success to be nature itself. The winds atop the building were described to be violent, forceful and unpredictable. As a result, mooring dirigibles to the mast ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). Moreover, the violent winds made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mooring mast. In December 1930, the captain of the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" feared that ""the wind would blow the dirigible into the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" (paragraph @NUM3). In effect, the idea of using the mooring mast to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building quietly disappeared. As described by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.",4
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""

In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steel Frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This shows that at first the building was not strong enough to hold such weight. Another problem was nature. The workers had to take nature into effect. If they had a dirigible or a blimp up there the wind could potentially harm the dirigible. There was also a law in place that for bid aircraft to fly that low. Finally, workers had to make the height exceed any other height that was taller. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 says ""In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire... would reach 1,250 feet..."" John Tauranac also followed by saying ""Their top they said would serve a highe calling.""

"In the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lsted, obsticals of the Empire State Building faced to attempemt to allow dirigibles to dock there were enginering challenges. A problem with the docking was that the building was complete before the idea came to mind. A second problem was that the whole skeletal structure had to be changed in order for dirigibles to be able to dock. Then the question on how the airships, dirigibles, would stay next to the building. These were harder problem after it was illigale to have dirigibles to be close to buildings as well. Plus the fact that if they crash they are flamable and could kill people. Those are some facts that made it difficult for the Empire State building to build a dirigibles docks in the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lsted.",3
"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, there is an obstacle the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. This idea would not work because the dirigibles is way to heavy, and that would cause more pessure towards the Empire state building. When there a massive amount of pressure on the building, it would collapse. ""The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another obstacle is it was expensive to build it. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" In New York there are many places and people are tightly packed. There isn't any space that is big enough for the dock. ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York city."" These are the main obstacles of the Empire state building to allow dirigibles to dock.",2
"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let dirigibles dock there. One obstacle they faced was that the building's frame would have to be modified. This was because the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building when docked on it. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was that it would be too difficult to keep the dirigibles still. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made it dangerous for passengers as well as pedestrians on the street and prevented the dirigible from getting close enough to tie up. A third obstacle the builders faced was that there was an existing law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas because it was very dangerous. Although it seemed like a good idea, there were too many obstacles and dangers involved in letting dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building.",4
"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most aparent problems was its a urban area with a lot of pedestrians walking the street. They didnt want to dirigibles flying so close over with out not knowing wha's gunna happen. Another thing was that the German dirigible had been destroyed by fire. They had to think about how worse that could have been if it was on the mooring mast, possibly killing people and completely destroying the building. Also how much more construction and money it would take for the Empire State Building to hold a dirible. There were many problems they didn't think about in the process, that's why the mooring mast wasn't successful as planned.",2
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. So in order to strengthen the frame it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another challenge was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. The last obstacle was safety because of an accident took place in downtown New York it would be devastating.",2
"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders faced was safety.  In paragraph @NUM1, it was said that ""most dirigibles from outside of the @CAPS2 used hydrogen rather than helium"", now hydrogen is highly flammable. In paragraph @NUM2, it states that ""if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"", now thats niether practical nor safe. If the ship is tied, the back should be stable. The last obstacle that the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low. In paragraph @NUM3, it applies that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Though some ships did attempt to reach the building, there was no success in that.",3
"When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was thought of, builders did not realize the obstacles that would have to be passed. One obstacle was ""nature itself. The winds, on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of the dangerous winds would be in 1930, the ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. A concern for safety was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If something wrong were to happen, there could be great consequences for the heavily populated downtown of @LOCATION2. A third and final obstacle that occurred was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of these obstacles, the idea to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building seemed impossible, and was never accomplished.",4
"Now, people know what a ludacris idea it was to have dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building; however, in the @DATE1's and @NUM1's people were oblivious to the idea many failures and the obstacles the builders would face. One obstacle that was faced was that most of these dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is extremely flammable and put the city at risk. Another obstacle was nature, due to the winds on top of the Empire State Building it was hard to bring the dirigibles remotely close to the mast. Yet another obstacle facing the builders of the mast was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Overall, the idea could not be projected into a real-life, visual interpretation because of the obstacles faced by the builders of the mast, now people have airplanes and airports to dock the planes - theres no use for the mast on top of the Empire State Building regarding aviation.",3
"Builders had to face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle is that it is unsafe to have it dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians. The dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether and that would add a lot of stress on the buildings frame. Another big obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Over @MONEY1 would be needed for this to happen.",2
"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building caused many obstacles. One of these obstacles was that dirigibles outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen rather than helium. Using hydrogen was highly flamable. They knew how dangerous it was. In the excerpt it says, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle people had to deal with was nature. In the excerpt, it says that air currents were ""violent"" and it would be very hard to control the dirigible. Finally, dirigibles mooring at the Empire State Building would be illegal. It says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not dock over a heavy populated city like New York City. Many obstacles made it challenging to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building.",3
"In building the dirigible docks on the Empire State Building builders faced an onslaught of problems that should have been easy to pick up on. Everyone got caught up in the hype in my opinion. Outside of the U.S., other dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. After the Hindenburg disaster, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Winds also played an obstacle in the construction. ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The dirigibles would not be able to tie to the dock and stay because of violent air currents. There was a law holding airships from flying too low in urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for air ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...,"". Finally, times changed and planes became the new fad for air transport, ending dirigibles run as the main provider.",3
"The builders ran into quite a few problems when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state Building. As stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium; and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would mean that if a docked dirigible filled with hydrogen were to catch on fire it would burn down the Empire State Building and much of the city, killing many people with its explosion. Another main obstacle As stated in paragraph @NUM2 was nature ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". These winds would make it almost impossible for a dirigible to reach the mast and actually dock. In addition the dirigible would be swinging around violently once it was tied to the mast The third major problem was the law against aircraft flying low over urban areas as stated in paragraph @NUM3 ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". With the law in the way no one would even want to try. Those are the three major problems found when building the mast",4
"The empire state building builders had to face hard obstacles by.... ""accommodating passengers,"" new routes, and the greatest obstacle was to nature itself. By accommodating the passengers they had to bring them to the existing transatlantic routes. This was because the new routes weren't made yet. Reasoning being is because the building needed to be more taller. So then they added more things on the top of it. They wanted the State Building to nature itself because the building @CAPS1 Shifting from ""violent air currents"". Also the dirigible was more open fields to the moor. The State building also was weight down by the lead weights.",1
"There are a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the violently changing wind currents at the height the docking to place. This would move the blimp and possibly send it into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. Dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself. It would disrupt the frame and possibly effect the building as a whole. Also most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable as seen in the Hindenburg disaster. Due to all these reasons the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp.",3
"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, engeneers fused several obstacle when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock in the @CAPS1 state Building. As stated in paragraph number nine, there @CAPS2 problem was ""the stress of the dirigiblel's load."" With all this weight being transmited to the buildings foundation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate its new situation This was verry expensive todo. Sixty thousand dollars wer nesciary.Another problem was that the blimps would not stay still while docked The winds would toss it around. A solution was putting waights at the back of the landing fields, but the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrans on the street"" like explaine in paragraph @NUM1. ",3
"When building the Empire State Building, builders were faced with several obstacles in their attempts to have dirigibles dock there. The builders first had to ensure that the building was going to be able to support the dirigible. After they completed this issues relating to safety arose. It was very dangerous to because some air ballons were made out of hydrogen which were flammable. If their were any issues, New York's population could be in grave danger. The wind also was an issue ... because it was so shifty a dirigble would be heavy in the back. Dangling above new york was very dangerous. The last complications that affected the idea of docking the drigbles was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area."" because of the law, safety and nature complications, builders were never able to successfully reach their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.",3
"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lsted, had many obstacles of the construction of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That law was considered illegal for a ship to approach the area and to get tied up to the building. Another obstacle was the lack of landing area, it was a challenge to expand in New York City, causing it hard to land dirigibles. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the weather would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. The author states, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.""",3
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One difficulty they faced was when they were designing the mast. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof..."" ( @NUM1) because it ""would add stress to the building's frame"". ( @NUM1) this was a difficulty because the Empire State Building's frame had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate it, resulting in @MONEY1 in modifications. Another difficulty faced by the builders was in regards to nature. As dirigibles use ""hydrogen instead of helium"" ( @NUM3), there was a great risk of fire; always a problem above New York City. The wind was also a problem. The winds on top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" ( @NUM4). The back of the ship would have to be weighed down by lead; again, not feasible in New York City. A final difficulty the builders faced were existing air laws. The builders' faced the issue of existing law against airships ""flying too low over urban areas."" ( @NUM5) This made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" ( @NUM5) Some of the many difficulties faced by builders of the Empire State Building were mast designs, nature and existing air flights laws.",4
"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, there were a lot of conflicts that the builders ran into while trying to let the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. One problem was safety. Unlike regular balloons, dirigibles were made of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamable. This would have been a problem if it was above people on the street and the building. Another problem was nature. The winds, where they would have docked, would have been way to strong. As the passage says ""the winds on top of the building were constanly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM1). One last reason is because there was a law against aircrafts from fly to close to neiborhoods. All and all the dirigibles ran into a lot of people.",3
"Al Smith, a former governor of New York had a brilliant idea to make the empire state building, the tallest building in the world.  He would put a mooring mast on the top to @CAPS1. dirigibles to the top so the dirigibles could let passengers off here.  But, this plan had many @NUM1, ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation"".  This is a problem because if the mast was just placed on the building, it would destroy itself.  Another problem is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen.""  Hydrogen is a very flamable gas, and would put the whole section of the city underneath the Zeppelin at risk.  The third Reason was an existing law which prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas.",3
"In the excerpt from ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS2, many obstacles are described from the construction of the Empire State Building in New York City. Thousands of dollars were spent on hopeless modifications to the building, in efforts to add a mooring mast to the top for the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. These efforts however were unsuccessful. Two main obstacles builders faced during construction were safety in nature. After a 1937 dirigible fire in New Jersey, owners of the Empire State Building ""...realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@NUM1, @CAPS2) and an existing law forbade low airships in urban areas. Also, the unpredictable winds provided workers with a very risky, dangerous situation in the end, although builders faced many obstacles during construction, diribles were never docked on the building.",4
"The Empire state building faced several major problems in making a station for diridgibles to dock. One is, that at that time there was a law prohibiting airships of any kind landing/docking in a residential area, never mind a densely populated city. There will were also many issues with practicalities with the mast, if it was even constructed. It would have been a huge hassle to get the huge airships docked, and keeping them there, never mind the extremely flammible hydrogen gas zeppelins were often filled with.",2
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was for many differents reasons. One of them is the wether, ""the greatest obstacle to sucessful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The second one is that they have a law aganist airships, ""was an existing law aganist airships flying too low over urban areas"". The also have have the problem is that the dirigible will be dangling high above people reads, ""...they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"". This is some of the problems that they have.",3
The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation.,3
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was attaching a mooring mast to the top of the building. Because of the height of the Empire State Building, they were unable to just drop the mast onto the roof for would have interfered with the buildings overall frame. In order to keep the mooring mast atop the roof, the architects spent thousands of dollars on modifying the framework of the building. Another obstacle for the docking of diribles was the preservation of the safety of the public below. Dirigibles were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, creating the risk of a massive explosion over New York and endangering countless lives. Lastly, a very important obstacle for the builders was the danger of nature. Violent air currents filled the winds above and around the Empire State Building. Even if a dirigible were strung to the roof, the back of the ship would continue to swivel, causing even more danger to citizens below the building. Those were some obstacles that builders faced and prevented to making of a mooring mast to let dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.",4
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the frame of the building. In @LOCATION1 @NUM1, it explains that attaching a durgible to the building would add stress to the building's frame. They had to modify the whole frame of the building to a stronger material for the mooring mast to work. One of the biggest obstacles was safety. Most durgibles use hydrogen to power them, and hydrogen is highly flammable. There is a great risk of the dirigibles to catch on fire when flying over such a densely populated area as New York. Another obstacle in the way of the mooring mast was the conditions at the top of the building. At the top of the Empire State Building, there are violent winds that would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Lastly, An obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As explained in @LOCATION1, because of this law, it is illegal to even fly up to the Empire State building. With all of these obstacles, it is clear why the mooring mast wasn't used.",3
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems while trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't just allow the dirigibles to land on the buildings flat roof, because it weighed too much and would add stress to the buildings frame.The plan never followed through for a few reasons. A big issue was safety. The dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The highly flammable substance was too dangerous to use above New York. The greatest issue was the wind. It was always changing because of air currents. The dirigible could be tethered down, but it would be floating in the air above pedestrians. The plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock their was a failure.",2
"While building the Empire State Building, Al Smith believed he had solved the problems of dirigibles having no where to land. However, having the building as a place for dirigibles to dock proved to be much harder than it seemed. First, the balloon would cause too much stress to the building's frame. The author states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Also, because this frame would need to be modified, a lot of money would need to be spent. The author states, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). It was too risky to invest on such an unsure project. Also, they realized how dangerous any accidents could be over such a populated area. The author explains, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). If anything had happened, a very large part of New York could have suffered. Although the plan of creating a mast for dirigibles was impressive, it was neither logical financially, or logical for saftey reasons.",4
"During the Building of the Mast, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 obstacle was the building itself. By adding the mast lots of stress would be added to the buildings frame and therefore strengthening modifications had to take place before the mast was erected. Another problem was how to tether the Blimp properly since they are generally landed in wide open fields which allowed for wieghts to be place in the front and back of the blimp, they could be secured properly. But since the blimp was going to be attached to a mast, there was no way to secure the back of the blimp and therefore no safe way to tie the blimp down. And finally the last problem builders faced was the how to even get the blimp docked. Since there was such high winds on top of the building there was no feasible way to dock the blimp in less it was perfect weather. Ultimately all those problems made it so the mast could never be used.",3
"Many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the empire state. One obstacle the builders faced was the law stating airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. Also, the builders would have to reinforce parts of the building to support the stress the dirigibles would place on the frame.Lastly, nature would not allow the dirigibles to be safely docked due to the fact the violent winds would shift the back of the dirigible making it sway wildly. These obstacles made sure that dirigibles could not be docked at the empire state.",3
"Te obstacles that the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the dirigibles would add stress to the frame of the building, The steel frame of the empire State Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this situation, over Sixty thousand dollars were needed to moderate the @CAPS1 Of the building, The greatest Obstacle was nature itself because the winds on the top of the building were Constantly Shifting due to violent Air currents. This were some of the obstacles to the builders of the empire state builders to attempt to allow dirigibles dock there.",2
"The obstacles that builders faced in making the Empire State Building a docking point reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. The goal's size was immense so the range was in its greatest. The problems were law, nature, safety, and the point of docking.Firstly, the main problem was the location. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like New York. Thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point. Lastly, law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was it was too close the public.Overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They made the goal so large, it caused the obstacles to reach their range of difficulty. The purpose of the Empire State Building may be a failure, but it still is the tallest building constructed.",3
"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when building the mask. The entire steel frame of the Building would have had to be strengthened to hold the weight of the mast. The mast, which towered at over @NUM1 feet tall, would have stressed the steel frame of the Building, making its foundation weaker. To hold the mast, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This meant that the builders had to really think through the process of how they were going to get the mast to not bend the steel frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was a new law that forbid airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Therefore, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the Building or even approach the area. ""Because of this law, the mast was very rarely used. Regardless of what they tried, the builders would have to make big changes to the Empire State Building's framework in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally projected. The mast did help make the Empire State Building the largest building in the world at 1,250 feet, but it forced strengthening and fixing of the building's framework, and the mask was not used as much as the builders thought.",3
"The builders came across many obstacles while trying to build the Empire State building for dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was just having ""... a single cable tether."" which they went on to say it would add stress to the building so they had to fix that. They choose to modify the frame and strengthen it as well. Another obstacle was having to get the right equipment. They had to go get some information from the @ORGANIZATION2 air station. The last obstacle would be the dirigibles were filled with oxygen instead of Helium. This had meant it was very flammable which was something the must consider. While trying to make this work for the dirigibles they came across building problems, safety, and dangerous problems.",2
"The builders of the Empire State Building's mast were confronted with many obstacles to overcome. Firstly, the builders had to compensate for the stress a docked airship would place on the building. According to @CAPS1, ""the stress... would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" As a result, the building's steel frame would need to be modified to accommodate the load. Another obstacle faced by the builders were the weather conditions at that height: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Any airship attempting to dock there would be violently buffeted around by the wind. Finally, there was the obstacle of safety. As @CAPS1 states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable."" @CAPS3 of a Hindenburg-type accident over a densely populated area gave pause to the builders. In conclusion, the builders had to face several huge obstacles, which combined eventually doomed the project.",3
"In order for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles (blimps), many obstacles had to be overcome by the architects. One of those obstacles was the Empire State Building's frame. If a thousand-foot dirigible was moored on top of the building with just a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the foundation of the building due to the dirigibles load and wind pressure. Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. Because dirigibles in the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding, and threatening the dense population of downtown New York City. Possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. On top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below. Those are some obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to dock dirigibles.",4
"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, a myriad of obstacles had faced the builders of the Empire State Building in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Because, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the dirigible and wind pressure. Next, safety became an issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigible's built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"", owners of the Empire State Building realized the hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An addition problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigibles back end swivel around the mooring mast, seeing as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2, it would be illegal for a Ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",4
"Ambitious for its time, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was doomed from the start.  The engineers and builders of the mooring mast were faced with many obstacles that could potentially inhibit safe docking at the top of the building. The first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock. As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""  Modifications would have to be made to the entire building.  Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building.  As described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible.  These obstacles, baffled engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the project was abandoned entirely.",3
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there were many and at the end the dock could not happen. One of the obstacle was that buildings foundation had to be modified. In the story it says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."". Being so high the dock would be moved around because of the winds. Also the blimp itself could not even attached itself to the dock because the winds wouldn't let it. In the end the dock wasnt meant to happen it came with a lot of problem for the builders and even the artitechs.",2
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted there are many obstacles that the builders stumble across. Many people would have a hard time with creating the docs for the dirigibles for the Empire State Building. One major obstacle that the builders had was ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Another obstacle that they could come across is that the dirigibles could take to long to fuel up and could cause a jam with other dirigibles. Even though they had this huge obstacle they managed to get their way and they found a way to actually use the dirigibles without any types of problems.",1
"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 she describies the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obsticles they faced where there was a lack of suitble landing area, they would have to reconstruct the building's framework, and there was a law against it. The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float eayser. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obsticle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible. The third obsticle faced was there was a law agianst it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State building the obsticles too face were to great for the builders with the lack of a sutible landing area, the reconstructing of the framework, and the law agianst aircrafts flying to low.",4
"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A practical reason why was a law against airships flying too close over urban areas like New York. The law would make it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the building. The greater reason was the issue of safety. If a ship came in to dock with use of hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion is possible, harming everyone bellow.The greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents. Even if tethered down, the ship would swivel around the tower getting tangled. In conclusion, the idea had to be dropt, though some ships have tried to dock their.",3
"I've been to the Empire state building before, right up to the top. The top was not opened, but several windows were, and our thing that still stays with me is how amazingly windy it is up there. Trying to park a blimp on top of the building would be like trying to park a car in a flood, impossible I was waiting for that factor to come up the whole story, and it finally did. ""The winds on top of the building work constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) In addition to parking the blimp, the passengers would have to get off on a swaying gang-plank, which would not be too fun. Another problem they faced was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) I would think that before spending @MONEY1 on an already unrealistic project, they would at least have made sure they were cleared law-wise. When I read this essay, it seems the project was doomed from the start.",3
"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. So Al Smith thought putting a mooring mast at the top of the building, would allow dirigibles to dock there several hours. It would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off. Another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored. It would be held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. Third obstacle would be using hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen it is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",3
"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted talks about The Mooring Mast or also known as the Empire State Building of how it was built and the original purposes of the building. During the making of the Empire State Building, builders faced issues in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there such as architectural problems, different gases, and the law. The builders faced a problem with the architect of building. The roof top was a flat as it says ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" That meant the heavy dirigible would add stress to the building's frame Another issue they faced was the gas some dirigible used @CAPS1 dirigibles were filled with different gases and ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It meant that the building could catch on fire and whole downtown New York. They also faced an issue with the law saying ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". It explains it would be illegal to tie a dirigible on the building",3
"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted explains the construction of the Empire State Building in New York. The excerpt explains the steps of building the building as well is the obstacles and challenges that the builder faced. The architects of building the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, did not take into account the problems that may come with taking on such a large project.The creator of this plan to build a docking mast on the Empire State Building was Al Smith. Al Smith was so excited to build the mast, that he did not think about the complications associated with his ""master"" plan. Because of the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure, it was necessary for the building's frame to be strengthened which costed over  sixty thousand dollars. The greatest obstacle for the builders was a matter of safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was known to be very flammable. If something like that happened over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This excerpt shows that before you leap on a large challenge, you should look and take into account obstacles that may come with that.",3
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were accidents over densely populated areas, violent air currents constantly shifting, etc.",1
"The idea to put a mast on top of the empire building @CAPS1 like a brilliant idea. People thought it would be a great idea to dock a dirigible on the mast, expecially because ""New york city was the lack of Suitable landing areas."" But it is easy to @CAPS2 how the mooring mast would never be able to dock drigibles. One reason this could never happen is because @CAPS3 of these drigibles contained hydrogen in them wich is highly flammable. ""When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey.... the empire State building realized how much worst that accident could have been."" @CAPS3 people would die if this happened over a highly populated area. Another reason that the mast would never be able to be used is because there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" @CAPS4 even if everything was Set up correctly they would be breaking the law flying there dirigibles @CAPS4 close to the city. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire State building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due violent air currents."" The mooring mast would just be a tottally unstable place to dock these drigibles.",3
"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects faced many problems. One of these problems was the buildings frame. The frame needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new mast. Another huge obstacle was safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author states, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to go up in @CAPS1 not only the passengers would be in danger but everybody on the crowded streets below. The winds at such a high altitude also posed a threat. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel all over the place, making it hard for passengers to unload. These were just some of the many problems builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.",3
"When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world's tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at forty-second  Street. and lexington Avenue in New York.

"It was unrealistic and also unsafe of engineers to think that they could have dirigibles dock on the building. One major problem with the idea that the dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. Also the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure would cause a problem for the foundation. Another thing, dirigibles were made up of hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if one of the exploded it would have been a disaster for downtown New York. This is why the idea is neither practical or safe.",2
"Based on excerpt, ""The Mooring @CAPS1,"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the violent air currents, and the safety of pedestrians.One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the violent air currents. According to the excerpt, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting. So if a dirigible happened to get caught in this they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Example of this would be, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring @CAPS1 the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM1) Another obstacle was the safety of pedestrians. When owners heard about the German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they decided that it would be even worse if it had taken place in a heavily populated place like New York. An example of this would be, ""owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.""In conclusion, the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", written by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Such as the violent air currents and the city pedestrians.",3
"The Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. This building being so tall, and large wind shifts were a constent worry. Wind shifts, is when the direction of the wind shifts suddenly. One minute its @LOCATION1, the next its @LOCATION2. On may 6, 1937, when German dirigible Hindenburg, caught on fire, people thought, what would have happened if that was over the empire state building. over New York, with such a large population, it would have been hectic. Airships werent allowed to fly that low anyways.",2
"The task of trying to allow dirigibles to dock 1,250 ft. above round over the city of New York not shockingly posted a few obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building.Before the dirigibles could even try to dock on the mast, the builders had to modify the whole building due to the stress and pressure on the building from the dirigibles. The modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building once the builders finally had all the modifications and building done; they were faced with a whole new set of obstacles. Most of the dirigibles from out of the united states were filled with flammable hydrogen. ""The german dirigible @CAPS1 was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION3, New Jersey"". This accident worried @CAPS2. Also they faced problems with the shifting winds and air currents that made it difficult to dock the dirigibles. Another obstacle was the fact that laws existed against airships flying too low to the ground. Due to these unforeseen obstacles, the idea of docking on top of the building disappeared.",3
"Based on the information given in the excerpt, there are multiple obstacles they couldn't have been overcome by the builders of the empire state building. Between the winds, problems with ancoring, risk of Fire and sharp spires, there were also legal issues that would first have to be bested.One thing the builders of the Empire State building hadn't considered was the wind current. Because the dirigibles were primarilly huge propelled balloons, the wind could push them around, and at 1,250 Feet, there isn't very much around to slow or block the wind. They also didn't think about the @CAPS1 that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very Flammable and if one was to ascend in @CAPS2, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people bellow would be doomed.More problems the architects face were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around. If a pilot were to lose control of the bimp, then it would cause @MONEY1 of damage to the city.Lastly, a new law was undergoing a legislation process. It prohibited the flying of any air travel bellow a certain Feet in residential areas.",2

The owners quickly realized how dangerous an accident would be ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"".The second major obstacle was nature; ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". A thousand-foot dirigible moored atop the building would add enormous stress to the frame of the building.In the end these two obstacles would be too great. Times were changing and with the air plane taking over modern travel the dirigible and the mooring mast were doomed.",2
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast of the building. They first had to do modify this top as a mooring mast and the steel frame of the building had to be modified to accomadate the dirigible. They also had to make a docking and ticketing area, which also costed money. They also had the problem if the dirigible hit something or caught fire by its hydrogen gas. Nature itself was the biggest problem because near the building, winds were violent. There also was a law stating that dirigibles or airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. If the shell broke, the dirigible could hurt many people.",3
"When the builders of the Empire State Building were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they had great intentions but faced some obstacles along the way. This job was not an easy thing to accomplish, it's not as simple as it might sound. If the builders added a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame. All of the stress would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, so they would have to modify and strengthen the steel. This would cost over @MONEY1, and thats a lot. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the wind up at the top was constantly shifting. This wouldn't be safe either. There was also a law against airships driving too low and this would enable them from being able to dock. Also since other dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, it could easily cause a fire. The main obsticle for the builders was saftey when they were building this, there were many unsafe outcomes so it was too risky to construct.",3
"One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the construction of the mooring mast would add stress to the building due to its height. The architects, however, were able to design a special type of stainless steel that would be illuminated from the inside and provide support. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and having such an airship with flammable gas nearby civilization was considered unreasonable. Thus, a law was passed that forbid the transportation of dirigibles close to the public. Nature was also against the architects, and so posed a safety hazard when high-speed winds attempted to @CAPS1 the dirigibles from the sky while being weighed down with lead weights. In the end, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was never used due to these issues.",3
"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, there. They had known that the mooring mast wasn't perfect. There were many reasons but the greatest one they said was the safety. The hydrogen in them is highly flammable and after the accident in New Jersey in 1937, they noticed how much more dangerous it would be if it happened right in New York. So they dropped the idea later on and left the transportation to the airplanes.",1
"There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major problem was the stress added to the building's frame when the dirigible wore it at the top of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to rearrange the frame to make it work. Consequently, the workers were never able to accomplish the goal. Safety was a major factor in the failure to dock dirigibles at the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigibles were highly flammable which could have caused a serious accident to occur. However, the ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 there were heavy air currents above the building, it would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"" when attached to the mooring mast. There was also an existing law that prohibited planes to fly low over city areas, which of making impossible for dirigibles to reach the building. As a result of all these obstacles, the main goal to dock dirigibles was not achieved.",4
"Obstacles that the builders had faced involved safety for those below the dirigible and those on it. One proble they faced was that if something happened to the dirigible like the Hindenburg. Then the pedestrians below could get hurt if the zeppelin came crashing down. It was also a problem with passengers because in a city they could easly crash. It tells how when the ""Los Angeles"" tryed to get close enough it couldn't because the strong winds so high up could have knocked it into a different building.Other obstacles builders faced were nature and the law. When high up wind currents can be very strong and changing. It talked of how if the dirigible were tethered the wind would cause the back of the ship to keep swiveling around the mooring mast. The final obstical builders would have to over come was the law. There were already laws in place preventing dirigibles to fly low in urban areas. If ships had tethered to the building than they would have been doing so illegally.",3
"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there The higher calling for which the mooring mast was built was to put New York on the forefront of modern travel; the builders then, needed to solve some obstacles that were on their way. First was that the building itself needed to get stronger in order to support ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"" As a result, the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the problem. According to the excerpt, @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. Lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the ""blimps"". To solve the problem, they built a shaft to bring passengers down to the @NUM1 floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The builders had to face many problems even before attempting to build a mast for dirigibles to dock at.",3
"Various obstacles came up in this excerpt. This building of the mooring mast simply went from a dream to more of a way to win a record for the world's tallest building. The greatest obstacle they faced was the issue of safety. In paragraph @NUM1 it reads ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, an obstacle faced was the danger of the dirigible being destroyed by fire while trying to dock on the Empire State Building which would cause a large amount of destruction in New York. The builders, also faced the problem of nature itself. The violent air currents at these heights would cause the dirigible to swerve around the mooring mast. The builders also faced a legal issue stating in paragraph @NUM2 ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". @CAPS1, the dirigibles were never going to be allowed to fly so close to the Empire State Building anyway. These were the obstacles faced by the builders.",4
"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph nine it states ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof."" This obstacle was massive because in order to accommodate the new station over sixty thousand dollars worth of work would have to be made to the building. Another reason as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" This shows this was another major obstacle for the builders. Another obstacle for the builders is nature as stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" this could be very dangerous. If the back of the ship was dangling over the streets surrounding the empire state building there could be many safety hazards. These obstacles were the main obstacles the builders had to face if the Empire State building would be a landing dock.",4
"Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as safety, nature, and legislation. First, it would be difficult to safely allow foreign dirigibles to dock. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This displays the fire, and therefore safety, was an obstacle. Next, air currents made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. The air near the top of the building was affected by air currents, so it was difficult for pilots to land. Also, ""using [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" There was no way to work with or combat the uncertainty of the wind, so nature was an obstacle. Finally, there were laws about aircrafts flying too close to the city. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""[There] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The very purpose of the moor would be illegal, so it would be nearly impossible for a dirigible to ever tie up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges regarding the moor, and its opening was never successful as a result of them.",3
"In the short excerpt, The Mooring Mast By Marcia Amidon Lsted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced was the space. An example ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" @CAPS1 saying it was going to be hard finding a place to land. Although that may had been one of their problems that was not the only problem it was the safety. The excerpt says, ""the mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service and to let passengers off and on."" Which meant it would have taken along time just land and fueling. Another obstacle was for the dirigibles to be tested in the testing of the mast",2
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle was finding a safe way to do it. New York City is a very densely populated area so any type of accident would be horrific, as the owners realized in @CAPS2 @NUM1, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident couldve been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as @CAPS1."" Another obstacle was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building was too strong as it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currants. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast."" Safety was clearly the biggest concern",3
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced law against airships flying to low over urban areas This law made it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building, fearing That The Wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in that area. That would harm the dirigible's shall Then another dirigible attempted a Publicity stunt, when it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspaper to the Empire state building. The Idea of The mooring was shelved. They yet unsolved Problems of mooring air ships to a fixed Mast at Such a height made it desirable. The highest open observatory dock, intended for disembarking Passengers, has never been open to The Public.",2
"The builder's main problem with safety. Most Blimps that aren't made in @LOCATION1 are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a disaster like the Hindenburg accident happened while the blimp was moving to the tethers at the Empire State building, the outcome would have been much more disasterous.

For example, on the excerpt is says, ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" This shows that builders had to build a mooring mast to have some time for refueling or service and have people get off and on safe.Another example from the excerpt is when it says, ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform."" This shows that the builders build a gangplank for people can walk up or down the gangplank safe from the dirigible.",2
"The builders of the empire State building were faced with many different obstacles. One was the empire State building it @CAPS1. It is one of the tallest buildings in the world so only construction plan that goes wrong could be trajic for all the people below. When the started Construction on the mooring mast they knew there was Some risk but didn't think it threw. See all this was introduced because Al Smith wanted the Empire state to be the biggest. Now he didnt @CAPS2 look into it if a blimp was to @CAPS3 on the mooring mast they would have to worry about weather, wind, and also the strength of the buildings foundation. Also they would have to worry about the blimp it @CAPS1 back then dirigibles were filled with hydrogen and if Something was to go wrong ever downtown New York and the blimp was to catch a spark it would burn four city blocks",2
"The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was laden with problems ranging from natural preventions to pre-existing laws. During the time of frequent dirigible travel in the world, a German dirigible called the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey due to a complication with fire. This catastrophe revealed to the workers a problem they had previously overlooked, the fact that most foreign dirigibles were inflated with flamable hydrogen gas. The idea of a problem like the Hindenburg ocuring over one of the most densely populated cities in the world ruled out the idea. The workers of this project also overlooked the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Although the empire state building was anticipated to be the tallest building in the world, the soon to be created mast would still be too close to the millions of people in the city. After test runs had occured to try out the new mooring system it was seen that dirigibles were not even able to get close enough to the mast due to the strong winds. The idea that these same winds would blow the dirigible into another buildings spire put fear into the minds of the people. The combination of this variety of problems put an end to the idea of using a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building",4
"Al Smith and the builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. First obstacle was designing strengthening beams to the frame and foundation to support the extra stress caused by the dirigible's load and wind pressure. The second was that the gases used in some dirigibles were unsafe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lsted, @NUM1). The inefficient the gases, the violent air currents would either cause the dirigible to spend, or add lead weights which would ""... be dangling high above pedestrians"" (Lsted, @NUM2). Among all of these problems ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (Lsted, @NUM3). Therefore, not only was it unsafe or impractical, it was illegal.",3

Another obstacle they came across was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM2). Therefore, the it would be illegal to dock a ship on the building, because the airship would be too low down. Finally, the most difficult obstacle they encountered was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM3).

""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", @CAPS1 @NUM2. However some dirigibles attempted to dock. In 1930 the U.S. Navy, Los Angeles tried to dock, but due to the severe winds could not. New York was a very densely populated area, and having explosive hydrogen floating low over the city could cause a huge threat. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" This showed the builders and owners of the Empire State Building that it was very dangerous for dirigibles trying to dock there. A main set of problems the builders faced was making the building itself strong enough to allow dirigibles to dock. The builders had to modify the frame of the Empire State Building and design a custom mooring device. The builders were faced with legal and safety problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.",4
"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted explains the plans for adding a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that would have been able to anchor blimps to the top of it. This idea was very complex; however, architects of time (@DATE1's) believed that it was quite possible. What they didn't seem to realize was just how many problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor set back was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was taken care of with little stress by simply modifying in strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". However, the absolute greatest issue that was faced was safety of the public. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which was ultimately why the mooring mast was never a success.",3
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Throughout the excerpt the author states that ""dirigibles were being hailed as the transport of the future"" (paragraph @NUM1). This means that builders had to work harder and figure out ways to get this to work. Architects and engineers talked with experts about the equipment needed to build the dirigibles. The author also states that they asked people to test the dirigible. They had to work on the mooring mast in order to get the dirigible to work properply. Getting the mooring mast to work was very difficult for the builders. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Dirigibles were basically given up on by the 1930's.",2
"The obstacles; the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were highly challenging. They delt with the frames and shapes, but theres other reasons that are not so physical.One of the greatest obstacles they faced to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was nature itself. At the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Using the Empire state Building, where the blimps would be dangling high about pedestrians on the lower level of the street, was not safe.Another particular obstacle they faced was; an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law made it illigal to ever tie up the blimp to the Empire State building itself. The blimps couldnt lad on the flat roof of the Empire state building. The builders of the Empire State Building had alot of obstacles in front of them. Not just physical objects to make it easier for the dirigibles to land, but the @CAPS1 of politics and nature aswell.",3
"In this excerpet from the mooring mast by marcia amidon, there was alot of examples of obstacles that the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one oBstacle that the builders faced was the weight and presure of a DiriGiBle @CAPS1 on @CAPS2 one teather at the top of the empire state building. this was a big @CAPS3 because all the stress and pressure of the rope would pull on the building sending the preasure all the way to the bottom of the building one thousand feet below. another obstacle that the workers faced was nature its self. this was a @CAPS3 because of the high speed winds at the building shifting all the time. If a DiriGiBle was to be teathered at the top by only one rope in the front the back of it would be free to move in the wind. this would allow the back to be able to be blown by the wind having the possibility of hitting the building. In conclusion there were many obsticles builders had to face to attempt this project.",3
"In the excerpt ""THE MOORING MAST"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted there were many obstacles that the workers had to face to allow Dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. One of the many obstacles the workers faced was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. Also the thousand-foot dirigibles moored at the top of the Empire State building. A single cable tether held the dirigible and it would add stress to the building's frame. The biggest obstacle the workers would face was the mooring mast on top of the building with all winds shifting due to vilent air currents. Another obstacle was the dirigibles were moored in open field and they were weighted down in the back. The problem was they were dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Those are the obstacles the workers faced",3
"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced were nature, safety and the law. Al Smith, @CAPS1 of New York and headed construction of the Empire State Building, was determined to make it the tallest building ever. This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for Dirigibles.In building the mooring mast, came obstacles. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth. Lead weights were typically used to keep from swaying, but if used here, lead weights would be dangling @NUM1 ft above pedestrians heads. Which leads to safety being another obstacle. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable, if ignited, the possibly largest accident would occur to New York City. The Final obstacle is the law. There is a law that states ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas."" Which would make the mooring mast's purpose illegal. Today, it is nothing more but decoration.",3
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared. They faced to many obstacles that could not be overcome.",3
"They ran into a few problems when it @CAPS1 to building this. They realized after that it wasnt that smart or that safe to have a dirigible hanging by a 102 floor building just by one cable tether. Another problem they ran into was the fact that they couldnt control mother nature. If it was a really windy day out it would be hard to keep it steady. And if there wasnt enough support on the building frames, then it could potentially collapse.",1
"The builders of the Empire State building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's back and to blow sideways and puncture on the tops of other buildings. On top of that, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked or collapsed the building and its foundation. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease production of the mast, because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers.",2
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles trying to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. Lack of a suitable landing area was a tough obstacle. It is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas. It would be dangling high above people and it wouldn't be safe. The way the dirigibles stays up in the air is it uses hydrogen instead of helium yet hydrogen is extremely flammable. To have a dock for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would not be safe and the builders would have to think of a new plan therefore, there would be many obstacles.",2
"During the @DATE1's technology and engineering wasn't quite as advanced. So it's safe to say builders of the Empire State Building had so obstacles. One of them were, how were they going to dock the dirigible safely and keep them stable, they had know idea. They did have the knowledge or technology to do such a thing back then.",1
"There were many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One problem that was addressed was the fact that dirigibles all over the world were mostly filled with hydrogen, which was flammable. This was a problem because on May 6, 1937 a dirigible was destroyed by fire and the owners of the Empire State building relized ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place of a densely populated area."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Another potential problem were the strong wind currents on top of the building, as described in @CAPS1 @NUM2. The concern was that these strong currents would prevent a dirigible from docking, and could possibly blow it into another building. This could puncture the dirigible's material and cause a horrifying accident. The final obstacle that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building was the fact that it was against the law. The law stated that ""airships flying to low over urban areas"" was prohibited. There were many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building.",3
"In this @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 the builder of the empire State building faced many @CAPS2 during the building of the Empire State building.The @CAPS3 obstacle would be the wind. Because The building was so high And the more up the more Air and wind they had to stop landing or Drop off the dirigible. A dirigible is also a ballon or blump but there different because the dirigibles can be controlled by pappellers. Another reason was the @CAPS4 equpment. They didnt have the right equipment to dock the dirigible. So they @CAPS5 from letting them dock there ever again. They also @CAPS6 to stop it because it's over hundreds of civilians and if something goes @CAPS4 the balloon could fall on the civilizians.Those Are the reasons Why in the @CAPS1-""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 had to face problems with docking ballons.",3
"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One example is, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. When the builders realized that hydrogen is flammable, they had to rethink the construction for if there was a fire it would be much more dangerous in a populated area like New York. The chances of people getting hurt or injured are more likely. Another obstacle was, ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building [because] of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This was a major obstacle because the builders would have been violating a law. It would also be very dangerous.",4
The builders of the Empire state building faced obstacles in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the winds at the top of the building were very dramicaclly shifting because of the air currents. Because of this the Dirigible end would swivlle around the top of the building. An other issue was the people walking the @CAPS1 of New York below the building. To stop a Dirigible heavy lead weights had to be used. This was problamatic because one of the weights could very easily come lose and @DATE1. The law that was about a flying airship lingering too low over a city would be broken if a Dirigible had been stationd at the Empire State building.,3
"Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a prominent issue; if human lives are at risk, an idea is not likely to be successful. Most foreign dirigibles contain hydrogen, an element that is ""highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1) and posed a threat to not only the passengers, but the people at the docking station as well. Another potential obstacle was the violent winds at the top of the building. These winds would cause the back of the dirigible to blow around freely with the wind. Even the proposed solution of weighing down the rear of the dirigible with lead weights was dangerous; lead weights would be left ""dangling high above pedestrians"" (paragraph @NUM2). A final and very obvious obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the pre-existing law prohibiting airships that fly ""too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Even with a safe docking station, landing would be illegal. Although it may have seemed like a feasible plan at the time, the idea of dirigibles docking on the top of the Empire State building was not a safe or practical one.",4
"While the construction of the Empire State Building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. At first, people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the ""transportation of the future"". One obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative effects on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". The builders would have to pay @MONEY1 to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas. Nature itself presented many more problems, such as winds blowing the dirigible onto the ""sharp spires of other buildings."" As numerous problems became apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the ""future of transportation"" was dropped.",4
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""the as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone"". This quote by Irving Clavan is saying that there is many problems unsolved because of the height made. Which means its harder to do because of how high it is. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamible."" They're pointing that out because if ever a chance of a mess up and it starts to come crashing down, its coming down on one of the most populated cities in america. These are some obstacles builders have to face.",3
"In The Mooring Mast builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles the builders faced were that they realized hydrogen was very flammable. An example from the excerpt is a German dirigible was caught on fire, the builders then thought how much worse it would of been over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the use of the mooring mast. The winds at the top of the building were harsh, and made it hard for landing. It was also a law that airships could not fly low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building then decided not to use the mooring mast for dirigibles.",3

There seemed to be many problems erupting during the making of the dirigibles dock. For one the Empire State building natural structure can't handle its weight. Therefor architects had to make a stainless steel tower. Even after this was made they realized how flamable helium and hydrogen are. Not only that the airwaves at the top of that building are extremely violent. The idea was eventually forgotten about due to the possible accidents that could happen.,2
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in building a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock on. The first obstacle was the inadequate framework on the building itself because with a mooring mast on top, much stress would be added to the building. It is said that ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" which could also be a cost problem. Secondly, building a mooring mast for dirigibles over densely populated New York City would be extremely unsafe. Dirigibles from foreign countries used hydrogen to keep them afloat, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, any fires above heavily populated New York City would have disastrous effects. Next, the worst obstacle the builders faced was the winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS2 a one thousand foot long dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building would be very unsafe because the winds would blow the back of the dirigible, therefore swivelling the ship around the mast. The final obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even if the building of the mast was a success, the law against dirigibles coming too close would prevent the use of it. All these obstacles the builders faced led to the ultimate failure of the mast.",4
"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with multiple obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although some of these obstacles were fixed early on, others were not brought to the builders' attentions until later on. The first obstacle that the builders encountered were the modifications that were needed to be done to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 nine). The Empire State Building would not have been able to support the mooring mast without having the essential modifications done. This process costed an extra sixty thousand dollars. The second obstacle that the builders faced had not even been brought up until after the building had been completed. The wind factor had made it nearly impossible to be able to dock any dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). With all the pedestrians located on the ground, this factor made it extremely unsafe. The final obstacle that was faced was with the law. Under already existing law, airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. Blimps docking at the mooring mast would be violating this law. The architectures and engineers of the Empire State Building clearly did not look into what was necessary to building the mooring mast.",4
"When architects and engineers planned on building the mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State building they didn't realize all the problems that could happen. One of these problems was a big safety issue. Most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a blimp were to catch fire while on the Empire State, it would end in a disaster. Another obsticle was nature. The wind was unpredictable and the dirigibles would just be swinging in the wind. If the wind got to strong it could add a lot of stress to the building and it could colapse. One last reason was an actual law. The law stated it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The mooring dock on the building would have never worked.",3
"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders had many obstacles to face. Most of the dirigibles used at the time were from countries other than @LOCATION1, so they used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable so if it caught on fire it would go down in a very populated area. Another obstacle was at that height, the wind was very strong and violent. When tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would be caught by the wind and swing around the mooring mast. The last obstacle was there was a law stating that dirigibles can not fly too low over urban areas this made it impossible for a dirigible to ever come close to the building.",3
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was one of safety, most blimps outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another obstacle the builders faced, was nature itself. The wins on top of the building are always changing because of dangerous air currents. These winds would cause the rear end of the blimp to move around and around the mooring mast.A third obstacle they faced was a law that aircrafts couldn't fly too low over pedestrian filled areas. This law makes it illegal to tie up to the Empire State Building.",3
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, including nature, safety, and the law, when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders' first imediate concern was for the structure of the building. When moured, the dirigible ""would add stress to the building."" To counteract this added weight, the building would need to be modified and strengthened. The builders were also worried about safety after a German dirigible was destroyed in a fire. Since the gas used to keep dirigibles aloft are highly flamable and downtown New York is so densely populated, they realized this could be very dangerous. The greatest obstacle was the high winds on top of the building that, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be swiveling in the wind. While lead weights could be used in open landing fields, these would be neither safe nor practical when hanging above pedestrians on the streets. Lastly, there was a law existing stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the building. The combination of these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to ever dock at the Empire State Building.",3
"In the excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury.",3
"The obstacles the builders had to face where rational, but there are some things you sould think of first, such as peoples safty, aircraft hight limets, and wind. They they thought about how to dock it, How to get the passengers safly to the landing area. What they did work on was smart though, they had the the thing that connects the dirigibles to the dock, the electric winch. They had a baggage, and ticket area. What they thought of was smart, but the other stuff first.",1
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when attempting to put a dock for dirigibles on top. In order to make New York City the most modern city for travel, Al Smith attempted to put a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. They did finish constructing the mooring mast, although the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened. The stress of the people boarding the dirigible could cause damage to the original framework. Once it was finished, there were @NUM1 attempts the board passengers onto the blimps. Although, they both ended in failure. The builders were not able to overcome the obstacles of the severe winds and laws. Winds could blow the blimp strayed into another building. Also, if a dirigible made of hydrogen was used, it could cause a fatal accident due to the high flammability of it. Finally, there was an existing law that airships from flying close to urban areas. The architects of the mooring mast were not able to overcome these challenges.",3
The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in atempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The bigest obstacle is to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state building. One set of engineers and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of moooring airships to this mast. The greatest obstacle itself was mother nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to vilant air currents. These are some of the many obsticles of the Empire State building faced wile atempting to alow dirigibles to dock there.,2
The following are obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. They were worried about the hydrogen and the helium being highly flammable and considering the disaster The Lakehurst Fire in New Jersey. They were also worried about the back weight of the ship. And they feared wind would be blowing it into the spires of the building which would puncture the blimp shell.,2
"Many obstacles approached the builders of the Empire State Building as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders put reality before theory in order to pick the safest route in docking a dirigible. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the builders realize how dangerous it could be putting that risk in such a densely populated area such as New York. The greatest obstacle in being able to dock safely was nature. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would sway the ship around the Mooring @CAPS1, becoming dangerous. The Mooring @CAPS1 project came to a hault in the late 1930s, in order to keep the people of downtown New York City safe.",3
"There are many reasons Why the builder's faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states that most dirigibles from outside of the United states use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The hydrogen can cause a fire and destroy the Empire State building and can destroy downtown New York. Another reason why the builder's faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is because it was against the law. In paragraph @NUM2 the exerpt states there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This could be dangerous to the citizens of downtown New York.",3
"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the idea of docking a dirigible to a building of such height.      Dirigibles, mostly outside of the U.S., were made with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is extremely flamable gas which was very dangerous above a highly populated are such as downtown @LOCATION2. Safety was a major concern an accident like Hindenburg was something they do not want to risk.      The ability of docking a lightweight flyer was also very difficut. With strong winds, after the tethor cable was attached, the back end of the air craft would be blown around making the aviator of the blimp hard to control.      Also, a law stating aircrafts may not fly too low to the buildings was stated especially after the incodent of hindenburg in New Jersey. A blimp could possibly hit a spire of another building     The reality of docking these lightweight aircrafts was a major saftey and difficult concern. These obstacles are what builders of the empire state building faced.",4
"The original plan for the Empire State Building was to be tallest building in the world, at @NUM1 feet. Everything was going well until the competition. The Chrysler Building, threatened to steal the title. When Al Smith announced that he was going to but a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, this obviously changed the architects designs. ""The architects desighned a shiny glass & chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back desighn that imitated the overall shape of the building. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners... and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" (Lsted). Two months after the workers started with the new plan, the celebrated because the finished framing the entire building ""The Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was safety."" (Lsted)",4
"There were many obsticles the builders of  Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One obsticle was the buildings frame was not prepared for it. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The frame of the building could not handle a docked dirigible. To fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have had to be made. Another obsticle faced by the builders was that most countries other than the United States use hydrogen instead of helium to make there dirigible fly. Hydrogen was very flammable and builders figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a desely populated area like New York, it would be devastating. The greatest obsticle faced by the builders were the wind on top of the building that was constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currats. While the digarble were tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles. They could not use lead weights to help hold the zeppelin steady because you can't just dangle heavy lead weights over New York City. From the beginning, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ridiculous.",3
The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building. They had to do this because the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Another obstacle they had to face they had to add to more floors to the building to make a grand total of 102 floor. The 101st floor was a glassed-in observation area and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor.,1
"The builders that were attempting to build a dock on the Empire State Building, had to face many obstacles. First, the girigibles were similar to huge ballons, @CAPS1 they were composed with hydrogen and helium. In the expert it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than, helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (pg @NUM1.) @CAPS1, if a dirigible caught on fire while it was stationed near the Empire State building, it may also catch the Empire State Building on fire. Resulting in a hazardous environment for the employees, and passengers.Next, attempting to tie down a dirigibles to a building, is known to be illegal. On the expert it states, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."". If anyone disobayed this law it may result in punishment; as a result, it would create a new obstacle the builders would have to deal with.Last but not least, the idea of docking airships to a building is extremely unsafe. ""The @CAPS2 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted gives an excellent third reason why airships are unsafe, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" If a disaster ever took place, many lifes would have been lost or severely injuried. Finally, the builders and architect would have an extremely hard time convincing high government officials to allw air ships to dock on the empire state building, because the bad certainly over powers the good.",4
"There is a lot of obstacles in trying to come with an idea of a building. They had to make sure the structure of the building was capable of the high winds it was going to get. Plus, they also had to make sure the top was safe enough for the dirigibles to dock there without harming any people or the building.",1
"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles. First, ""the lack of a suitable landing area"". They had to make room for the huge dirigibles to land. Second, ""add stress to the building's frame."" They had to make the structure of the building stronger so it wouldnt break. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" if they were going to be able to make this work they needed to find a way to calm the wind by the tower. Hence, In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles.",2
"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are brought out. The author brings our ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". The climate and winds were constantly changing at the height of the building. The back of the dirigibles would then swivel which could very well be dangerous. Also the builders had to take into account the fact ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" The Empire State Building is in the middle of New York, a highly populated State. The explosion of a dirigible at the top of the Building would be very dangerous & would lose a lot of lives. The builders of the Empire State Building under went many challenges in trying to allow Dirigibles to dock.",3
"As the Empire State Building was being built to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, the workers faced several problems in trying to accomplish this. The first of these obstacles to occurr to the workers was the framework of the building. The building needed to be sturdy enough for the blimp to dock there with the harsh winds constantly pushing the blimb in different directions. Without the proper frame work, it would be extremely dangerous to dock. The next obstacle for docking was the hydrogen gas powering the dirigibles. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and there had been other previous accidents with hydrogen blimps. The workers realized that an accident with exploding blimps would be very dangerous in a such ""densely populated area."" The final obstacle workers faced was the harsh wind currents at that altitude. The winds were so strong, that the blimps could not even get close enough to dock. The workers suggested weighting down the blimp would lead weights, but seeing as the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it ""was neither practical nor safe."" Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea. As time went on the obstacles preventing this became to great and finally shut down the idea. ",4
"Based on the excerpt there are a few key obstacles the builders face, one being the safety of the people in the dirigibles and people below them, and two being nature itself.The safety of the people was critical because if something was not safe then it would not be put to use. There were many things that could go wrong such as, the blimp hitting a spire and killing all the people below.The Greatest obstacle was nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast it would get wraped around the building, or just getting to the mooring would be difficult because of the wind.Overall the mooring mast was not a practical Idea. It was just something thought up to compete with the @CAPS1 building, and was not thought through with the aspects of safety in mind.",2
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One important issue was the Mooring Mast. According to @ORGANIZATION2, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (paragraph @NUM1) Another problem would be the dirigible's load. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (para. @NUM1) One of the main things the architects forgot to take into consideration was the buildings frame. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.""(para. @NUM1) The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",2
"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was lack of suitable landing area; ""so were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" Another obstacle was the wieght of a mooring mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" which means they would have to modify the whole frame to bare the weight of the mooring mast which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Safety was also an issue. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a highly populated area such as downtown New York than the accident would be much worse. Another issue was the fact that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Because of the wind the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast.",3
"allowing dirigibles was going to be the new way of transportation back in the 1920s. There were many problems with having a mooring dock on top of the empire state building.one of the main problems was it was flamable. The helium and the hydrogen gases that lifted the dirigibles. If there was the smallest spark the entire Dirigible would go up in flames in a second. For an example The hindenburg German zeppelin that exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937. So the thought if that had happened in a more densely populated area like downtown New York it would of been much worse.Another problem with the dirigibles was wind. If there was strong air currents the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast when it was docked. aqlso it is weighed down by the lead by lead weights. If it is over pedestrians It is not safe.",3
"Based on the excerpt from the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in building the mooring mast. For example, there was actually a law that prohibited exactly what the builders wanted. The law said that airships could not fly too low over city areas. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building would directly violate that law when the ships come in to dock. Another problem the builders faced was the danger surrounding the airships that would be docking there. The airships, called dirigibles, were like giant balloons and could pop if they touched something sharp enough. The Empire State Building was surrounded by other extremely tall buildings and most of them had long spires on top. Therefore, if the dirigible bumps one of these spires, it could pop and go plummeting to the ground. This presented another problem. Had an airship popped in New York City, it could've killed a large number of people not only in it, but on the ground. During the time of building, the Hindenburg crashed into fields, killing all of it's passengers. The builders thought what the consequences would be if that had happened in the city. This was the final straw for the builders as they abandoned their lofty goal, because of too many problems.",3
"The builders of the Empire State Building taste some obstacles in attempting to have a dirigible dock.  The dock would break the laws.  The dock would also be a danger to the people below.  It would also put a lot of stress to the frame of the building.""",1
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted their were obstactes the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was the terrible winds. In the excerpt it states how bad the winds are. One dirigible was going to try to dock there was the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't get close enough because of the very strong winds. The Captain feared the wind would blow the dirigible into a sharp spire on one of the buildings in the area and puncture the dirigible's shell. Another reason was their was already a law that stated against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it. The last and final obstacle they faced was the fear of crashing. Since most blimps from out of the country used hydrogen rather than helium it was dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. They heard about the blimp fire in New Jersey they realize how much worse an accident like that would be on such a densely populated area like downtown New York City. And that is the obsacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The huge wind gusts. The Law. And don't forget what happens of the dirigible crashes in the area of New York City.",4
"When constructing a building, workers will face tough obstacles, ecspecially when it comes to building the Empire State Building. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Al Smith and other architectural builders faced many problems. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Also, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Both of these obstacles were reasons that explain the failure of the mooring mast. The builders were not successful at their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.",2
"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles. The first problem was the material of the dirigibles. Dirigibles ""were actually enormous steel frame balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium make them lighter than air."" The first problem is that it's material could be broken if happened to fly into a sharp area of the building, and the ""violent air currents"" did not help. Since the dirigibles could not be weighted down at the Empire State Building, it would be dangerous to have them ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" Another obstacle was the fact that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. Although dirigibles from the United States were filled with hydrogen and helium, ""most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With these obstacles builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there, the theory did not work out in reality.",3
"Although thousands of dollars and countless hours were spent on the Mooring Mast, certain obstacles prevented dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons. First, these dirigibles were not safe to fly over populated areas. Some contained the highly flammable gas hydrogen. Also, a German dirigible called the ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames in New Jersey. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The winds at the peak of the Empire State Building were violent. It is stated in paragraph four teen, ""The winds on top the building were constantly shifting."" It would not be safe to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building.",2
"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast,"" many obstacles created problems for the builders of the Empire State building and their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle that came across the builder's minds was that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" (paragraph @NUM1) because it would damage the building with the ammount of pressure pulling on the structure. The second problem that the architects faced was safety. Events from the past such as Hindenburg was caused by the use of ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable...the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could've been."" The next problem that came up was nature itself, such as dangerous winds. An event when ""the U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 there were legal issues, and existing law was against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal.",4
"The builders of the Empire state building faced the problem of how to keep the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind. They were unable to solve this problem, as we see in paragraph @NUM1 where it says: ""Even if the derigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem with docking blimps on the Empire State building was a law that stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas. There is proof of this in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" One more problem with mooring dirigibles on the Empire State was that it was hard for pilots to dock their ships on the mooring. An example of this is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.""",3
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Obstacles they faced were the strength of the framework, Safety of the dirigibles, @CAPS1 nature, and a law. The first obstacle, framework, wasn't too hard overcome, it cost @MONEY1 to strengthen it in order to support the mast and a blimp. The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. By using led weights to weigh down the back of the blimp would be neither practical nor safe hanging high above pedestrians. The final and forth obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to even attempt docking to the mast.",4
"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast, Empire State Building building faced many obstacles. One problem they encountered was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles rather than the use of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and actually caused a dirigible to be destroyed by fire. Also, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult for a dirigible to stop swiveling around-a safety hazard for pedestrians below. Lastly, it was illegal for aircraft of any sort to fly so low over urban areas. At first, the idea of the mooring mast was well-liked but in the end it had too many problems and proved to be impractical.",3
"In the 1930's the world was evolveing and new technology's were comeing of age. One of these tecnology's was the Dirigible and some people thougt to expand it's use. One of these idea's was the moring mast on the Empire State building. This was a great idea but the things that stood in it's way made it impossible. A major problem was the safty, consdiring it was 1,250 feet up. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If this thing caught on fire, everyone inside would burn to death or crass into the ground and kill everyone under it. Another huge problem was the winds and ease of pushing it off corse. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These winds made it simply impossible for this to happen. One problem that should have bee looked at from the beging was law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airship's flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 this moring Mast was a fantastic idea, there were to many things standing in it's way.",3
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, describes complicated obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was competition. ""It was planned as the world's tallest building taller even than the new Chrysler Building,"" (@CAPS1 1). ""Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). There was a competition as to had the tallest building between the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Another obstacle, was the safety and dirigibles. ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurts, New Jersey, The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populate area such as down town New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The owner didn't want to risk a accident to cost people's life it would have been bad rep for them. The obstacles that the builders went through was a positive thing, it made them @CAPS2 and open their eyes.",1
"There are many obstacles faced because of letting the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. First, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This means that the winds ontop of the building were strong and will cause the dirigible will swivel around the mooring mast, if tethered. Also, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the areas."" This shows that it was a waist of time thinking ships could moor at the State Building because there is a clear law against it. There still are many obstacles you have to over come for any project.",2
"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there are three main obstacles prevented the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building from being used in the way it was intended. The first obstical was that it lacked safty. Dirigibles are highly flammable machiens when used with hydrogen, and a fire in New York City would be tragic..  Another obstical that the Mooring Mast faced was @CAPS1 Nature. The mooring was designed to attach to the dirigibles with a electric winch, allowing the dirigibles to move freely. When the winds of @ORGANIZATION3 were to blow on this situation, the diridles would ""swivel around & around the mask"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) this would cause tension to build on the buildings frame and lead to a very unsafe inviorment. The last reason was that there was a law created that stated that it was illegal for a ship to fly too close to urban areas for safty reasons leaving the whole Mooring Mast to be unusable.",3
